"i bought 3 sets of these blades for my cars. they lasted 2 weeks (at the most) on average in the summer. bosch or anco blades usually work for 2 years. it's up to you to decide which blades to buy!follow-up: i see some people find my review not helpful, you know what: i tried to warn you. obviously you either have too much money or you're stockholders of rainx. my advice for you: buy garbage, support economy",0
i bought two pair in different sizes and one pair was great but the other pair had deteriorated edges that left water in lines from the first use and one lock didn't secure the blade to the arm well. i had to buy a replacement immediately,1
lasts only 2 weeks! try them if you don't believe me,1
what a bad product!  they didn't last two weeks before they began to smear my windshield,0
bought 3 pairs for all my cars. what a waste of money: didn't last a week before they started to smear windshield! garbage,0

"i had a pretty dirty car and i used the mr. clean starter kit. i followed all the directions.i also washed my car in the shade, and i rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. i waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. it still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing i did during the soaping step. it even took more water than what i would have used washing it the old fashion way. i looked that the faq sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. it's just a hassle. at least i can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. otherwise it's a waste of money",0
"i bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  when i first used it, i followed the directions as indicated on the box.  worked fair the first time, i mean i could have just used my dads power washer but no, i am a pioneer and want to try new things.  so then i used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left scum everywhere!  this wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  i spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this scum off the car.  so i swore i wouldn't use it after all that happend.  so today i decided to wash my car because i'm moving to arizona in a day.  i used the power washer with a new bottle of mr. clean soap. i mean hey...what would go wrong....more of that scum, so here i am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  mr. clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one",1
"i bought this product on a whim.  i was looking for carwash detergent at safeway, and the mr. clean autodry was on sale.  curious, i gave it a try.first of all, this unit wastes a lot of water.  after washing and rinsing, you have to apply filtered water all over the car from a distance of one feet.  it feels like spray painting.then you wait for the water to evaporate.  problem is, i live in san franisco, ca -- nothing dries in this climate without help.  if i hadn't hand dried my car, i'd still be waiting for the water to evaporate.another odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using the mr. clean soap and unit.  it's as though it left a residue.  i'm not sure what it is.but i'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow, the old-fashioned way ..",0
"i seriously hope that the price tag i am seeing is ($7,000+) is a mistake..",1
impossible to rate product as amazon shipped brake cleaner instead of polish. return of inexpensive items not worth the time it takes.  consider not using amazon for small purchases until return system is upgraded,1
ok it's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate. i thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it (and even then the edges are blurry).  check the laws in your local state. i'm pretty sure this thing is very illegal!!! i had to trash mine. thanks for taking my money,1

"i just received the gauge and i'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes:- the hose didn't seal well on the tire valve- when bleeding air, the display didn't update. you have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. this is ridiculous.- the display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itsel",0
"if this gauge cost $20 i would give it a high rating, but even at the discounted $35 price i see for these gauges i think it is bad value, let alone the nearly $50 it cost me!as mentioned hose is very inflexible at cool, not just cold temps, general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this, mine is now leaking badly and i am trying to repair with quality materials, as i still hope to use the gauge part anyway. i would not buy again",0
"it appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously.  the reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  the reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.the quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  the hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.i used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold i mean 45f, this is houston...) and the display read 'lo', indicating a low battery.  so essentially the gauge was useless.  the hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it",1
"as other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  it may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  calling it a ""racing"" gauge is ridiculous",0
"i had the same problem described by r. nielsen.  the gauge would not take a new reading after i pressed the release valve to let air out.  it only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  i called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that i should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  i returned it to amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  i contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  i have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  the second replacement also had the problem.  customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.six weeks later (november 27th) i received a properly functioning gauge.  so it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  there was just a very large run of defective ones.  at this point, i would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.if yours is defective, you should contact accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240.",0

i bought this item and i literally hate it.  they make it seem so simple and easy but the blade does not do a good job in removing water from car surfaces.  i would only recommend it for doing windows.  much easier to use chamois or regular old terrycloth towels,1
"i got this item for my coffee-loving truck driver husband.  when we took it out of the box, we saw the obvious problem:  the ""mug"" is tiny!  only a bit larger than an espresso cup.  to add insult to injury, it took way too long to brew for such a small cup.  now it's back in the box collecting dust and we're sorry we wasted our hard-earned money",0
"this bag was junk on a 2001 4runner.  the poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload.  i realize it isn't made for all vehicles but i purchased mine only after speaking with lund, who confirmed the bag would work on my vehicle.  spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware.  great service from amazon, terrible service from lund",1
i had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. i bought this one thinking it would be better. the first time i used it i couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings.  it also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. it would disappear before i could read it fully.,0
i have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. the first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. i returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. i am moving on to another brand.don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items,0

it's a pain because to save time you need to install it permanently to make it worth it.  then you can never use that window for anything else. it's a pain because it will not work on tinted windows.run,0

"don't waste your money. that's the short version. no stars for this p.o.s. want more? ok - once you've fiddled around and fitted the rubber strips to your window, hooked on the device, rolled up your window (facing the sun, of course) you're now late for whatever it was you just parked to go do. oh yes, and it doesn't do anything other than spin a joke fan that couldn't move a feather. i put my hand in front of it and felt nothing - no wonder my car still feels like an oven. we can't drive off with it on, as the wind noise is unbearable even after unhooking the unit. why? because of the 'sealing' rubber strip you've hooked over the top of the glass leaving a nice 4mm gap for the wind.i thought i was smart going on ebay and buying two for the price of one. i would have been smarter spending the money on lottery tickets",1
"does not work (cool the interior of the vehicle) barely at all, compared to the ads.  so false advertising.  i purchased 2, and one also broke right away. very cheaply made product also.  would never purchase again, nor recommend to anyone",0
i purchaced this product because its a great idea.  the problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel. also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out. also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window.hopefully they can take this design an improve the suction and maybe add a battery. similar to the solar lights you put in your driveway,1
absolutely useless.  do not buy this product.  you are wasting your money.  learn from me.  i wasted on two!  they are tiny tiny fans that move hardly any air at all.  also they do not work on tinted windows.  trust me.save yourself some money and just crack your windows.  it works 100% better,0
"it worked for me! my car is now a blistering 120 degrees as opposed to the scorching 121 degrees a month ago. the only thing i ever got out of this product was screwed. i've been bamboozled!! don't believe the hype; stand up against the man!, chumps unite! god! what a piece of poo.",0
"i also purchased this product & was extremely disappointed when i found out it did not work.  like the 1st reviewer wrote, it basically is a mini-fan that moves but it does not cool the car down at all!  there was absolutely no difference in the temperature of my car after i installed it!  don't waste your money",0
"to turn off your check engine light on most vehicles, with your vehicle turned off, pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle. in most cases the light will shut off. if there is truly a problem with you car, the light will either not stay off or come right back on. you do not need this device to do that. the second problem is if your car does need attention, this device won't really properly diagnose or certainly won't fix it and you'll still have to go to a mechanic. so i'm left wondering what good this is",1
"it is ok for small dogs, large dogs will knock it down",1
"maybe it depends on the car, but i couldn't get it tight enough in my suv to prevent the dogs from knocking it down.  it also probably depends on the dog.  if the dog really wants to get past it, they will.  if you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a ""psychological barrier"", this would be ok.  oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the ""trombone"" style sides slide easily back and forth, i had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place",1

"if you've seen the movie ""cars"" and figure that it's time that you gave your rusty bucket the ""radiator springs"" make-over special, you might just be tempted to get yourself a batch of this stuff to make it smell as good as it looks.sure - it says ""new car scent"", and it has a picture of a car and a nice ribbon and everything - but i would definitely not use this stuff in my car.  first of all, it doesn't smell anything like the interior of a new car, and inhaling this stuff in that small an area would be lethal, even if you drive a hummer.  it is super-concentrated, and a one second blast is enough to saturate a 10 ft x 10 ft room with an unpleasant chemical smell, which might just be able to eliminate you and yours along with the airborne bacteria, smoke and odors. i can't vouch for any of the claims of air cleansing, sanitizing, bacteria reduction or removal of smoke and odors, because after the first test spray (in my office on a friday afternoon) i vacated the premises under duress, and by monday morning it had thankfully dissipated.  i've never used it again, and even though it may conceivably be the best airborne germ killing thing-gummy ever invented, the smell makes it impossible to use in the presence of living, breathing people. to be fair, the write-up never actually states that it is for cars, instead listing schools, medical facilities and food-processing areas, but then why on earth would you want any of these places to smell like a new car?  and why would you need a one ounce bottle of product for your factory?  the claims of deodorizing and leaving a fresh fragrance certainly didn't happen for me, and unless you come from somewhere where the pollution smells worse than this, i couldn't recommend it.  amanda richards, july 28, 2006",1
"the cushion was designed for what i needed due to an injury, but the curve of the cushion, the pressure points, and the density of the cushion are wrong.  i guess you get what you pay for.  i have found a similar cushion that works very well",0
"i bought this cushion hoping it would make sitting at my computer for long hours more pleasant. unfortunately after about half an hour, the ""memory foam"" gets totally squished down and it's almost useless. don't try to save money by getting this cheap one - spend the extra money and get one that doesn't suck.",1

this product came quickly but i should have listened to the other reviewers. they said the cushion would squash flat in a week and it has. just spend the extra dough and get some thing of a better quality. otherwise you will regret it in the long ru,1
"this cushion is very disappointing. in less than a week, it has gone completely flat and the seams have separated. i am not a large person either! it doesn't even puff back up when i don't use it. don't buy it; it does not do anything it is advertised for",0
i had been wanting this for 2 years due to having a cracked tail bone several times in my life. when i saw it at this price i bought it right away. i'm here to tell you not to waste your money! i only weigh 100 pounds which is small for an adult and when i sat on this hoping it would keep my tail bone lifted the pillow completely smashed down flat with no support what so ever. it was a big disappointment,1

"i was so excited about this bag but it was a huge disappointment.  the description clearly indicates waterproof, but in fact it is mostly water resistant, an 8 on a scale of 1-10 according to the box.  and since our travel coincided with several rain storms, this was a very important differentiation!the straps for the 'net' are extremely unmanageable and there are several key elements missing from the instructions.  having never used a roof top cargo bag before, this presented quite an obstacle for me.  there are loops through which you send the straps for the net that holds the bag down, the instructions make no mention of them, do you loop the strap through before or after you loop it through the luggage rack?  does it make a difference?  it took me 45 minutes just to get the thing attached to my roof due to trial and error (not counting loading time).the clips themselves are very poor construction, one of them broke upon tightening and had to be makeshift tied instead.the straps also do not tighten very easily, you have to feed the straps through the clips and then keep moving the clips back and forth until you get it to the length you want.the stitching also started ripping when trying to close the very stubborn zipper.  the bag was not overstuffed.i cannot recommend this product",0

"i purchased this for my 2001 vw golf, and it did not work. i know some of the other vehicles wire directly in, but you have to put a spare key in the unit and wrap it around the ignition. it made the install seem very half-a**ed. i could have just taped the key to the ignition at that point. i will get the immobilizer delete software instead of this junk. thumbs down from me on at least vw and audi application",1

"march 14 follow up report: pump found to stall and stop at 40 pounds pressure. teresa k. naeole of q. industries by phone said i could return pump and would be sent a more expensive tire pump in return. returned pump was received at 159 islington on february 16 at 12:55 pm. i have not received a new pump. i cannot get a response from telephone message requests at (303) 629 7700. almost a month now. yuk! pauli purchased the hv30 portable compressor because it promised rapid inflation of tires and blowup toys. the 140 pound pressure limit was certainly adequate. the price was right.the compressor comes with a hose that screws onto the compressor on one end and screws onto the tire valve stem on the other end. the compressor end thread was damaged. i had to use a pliers to tighten what should have been a hand tightened connection. because the tire end screws on, air is lost as it is unscrewed after the tire is inflated. most tire inflators come with a quick disconnect. further, the compressor won't start against tire pressure if the connector hose is screwed on the tire valve. i had to start the compressor and then screw the hose onto the valve stem.i haven't tried inflating a bike tire yet. i strongly suspect the air lost during unscrewing the connector hose will almost deflate the tire. this is just a great idea for inflating tires much faster than with pumps designed for much higher pressure limits but really poor engineering execution",0

appears to be a good product with one major exception. you can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. the blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find. i find it unbelievable that any company producing this item would not include 4 feet of cheap cord so the product could be put in service at once,1

"we purchased this rooftop cargo carrier to transport our suitcases and beach items during our summer vacation to new england.  we were initially concerned because it was so inexpensive for the size and worried that it might not fit a trailblazer.  upon arrival we were pleased to find that it not only fit securely, but was rather stylish too.  although it appeared weatherproof we soon found that it was not.  it began raining at the onset of our trip.  about four hours in to our fourteen hour roadtrip the weatherproof lining began disintingrating.  by the time we arrived at our destination all our possessions were soaked and coated in tiny grey vinyl flecks.  this cargo hauler might be cheap and look nice, but it is not worth your money",1
"one day when it was 100 degrees outside, i used it in my car, rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop.  when i came out and got into my car, it was hotter than i could have ever imagined.  it hadn't cooled my car prior to that either.  it looked like a very small fan blowing, and that was it.  i came home, took it off, and threw it out.  i was not satisfied at all",1
this includes a big piece of gooey tape to seal the window of your car when using this item--who's actually going to put this on their car? it makes the whole product useless and basically something to throw away. check the picture--see anything messy you have to stick onto your car? misleading and a waste of money. don't buy it,0
these are more of an accent light than task lights...not what i expected.  should have paid attention to other reviews,1
a tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well. that is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire. my accugage was reading 5 psi high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer. that's why i give it only one star,0
"i had this alarm professionally installed by pepboys (which is designtech's recommended professional installer). after the initial installation with all the wiring was done, pepboys found out that the brain was defective. they confirmed this as well with several tests that they did. after being on the phone with designtech's horrible customer service, and several faxes later, they sent me a new brain, and i just mailed out the defective old brain with a prepaid mailing label that they provided. after my 2nd visit with pepboys, it was the same problem. and yes, designtech sent me a defective replacement. several more calls and faxes later, i got the 3rd one, and that one turned out ok.the features worked fine, and the batteries lasted me a long time. but the fob themselves are made up of really cheap looking plastic (even the silver one). other than that, it worked fine. i got a new truck, and this time i've invested in an audiovox system (sold under the pursuit brand) and i love that everything is so integrated and easier to upgrade. i still had a professional install it and i've never had any problems with it.",1
"easy and clear steps to follow in installation, although the universal remote is really bad, feels very cheap...tachless mode works great, but finding service and tech support is almost impossible...good luck contacting them",1
"the design tech deluxe remote car starter comes with excellent features and a compact remote.  the problem is, the item i received did not work.all wires were hooked up appropriately and double check with a test kit.  once hooked up, there was no response from the unit.  after hours of attempting to troubleshoot, i looked online at design tech's website for local authorized installers in the hopes that they might be able to answer my question.unfortunately the three ""authorized"" installers in my area refused to touch design tech's equipment because, and i quote ""they're too difficult to work with.  we haven't had much success.""  a little alarmed by this response, i attempted to contact the company using their 800 number during their live tech support hours.  after waiting 1/2 on hold with no approximate wait time and no end in sight, i hung up and decided instead to return the defective unit back",0
"this item performed as expected, reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with obd-ii connector. easy to use - only 2 buttons! you might be able to find it $10 cheaper at a local store on sale, but even at the price i paid it was a bargain! cost of tool = 1 diagnostic visit to local shop",1
this obdii reader is way too simple. doesn't really do much in diagnostic. could not reset anything. save up and buy a bit more better unit,1
"the product would not put out enough current to help with the drain on my battery. i think i purchaced too small of a unit for my needs.  may work well with a smaller type of battery, not on a car battery",1

(on this car the cigar lighter is ""live"" even when the ignition is off).  the sunforce 50012 worked for one day.  next day it appeared dead (there is blue led that blinks when it is working).  i picked it up, it started working, sat it down, it quite.  twisted it, it worked, then it didn't, then it did.  the old intermitant (sp) connection problem.  basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it.  long story short, i fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components.  i am smart and lucky with nothing better to do.  99.999% of the users could not make this fix.  so just forget about it.  this thing is garbage",0
bought 2 of these.  both failed at extactly the same time after a few months.  save your money,0
it took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi.  truck air? -- it could barely fill a car tire.  it would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it.  stay clear.,1
"we received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it.  not only does it not fill anything pass 15 psi, the 12v cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig. lighter.  the plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out.  with the few more times we used it, i the tip completely broke.  at least it comes with 7 year warranty.  save yourself the disapointment and headache",1
last time i purchased them they came in a nice sleeve.  these are awkward and only have a band to wrap around them.,1
we live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car. we bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than amazon (think a auto store). anyway we did what it said and did it several times. it did take some of the ding out but not all of it. we barely got the glue off from it. a few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect. sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. i also watched fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either. i know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there. don't buy this product it is worthless.,0
i would have purchased this ridiculous item if not for the comment above.  thanks for alerting me to the misleading information,0
"i returned the activation card without activating because i was misled by the description of the product.   i understood that the eautorepair activation would be for a multitude of ""vehicles from 1983 to present"", but the card is for only one vehicle per subscription.........not mentioned in the description",1
i think i must have got a bad batch because this polish is highly rated.  it never dried to a haze for me.  the first time i used it i thought i hadn't shaken the bottle enough.  the second time i shook the bottle - seven days later it still hasn't dried enough to buff off.  i'm not sure if its the product or whether amazon are selling an inferior conterfeit,0

"the seat covers are cute, but only 1 comes in a box and while i was putting them in my car one of them ripped! obviously the quality is not very good",0
"i work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke.... with the money that you pay for a filter and 5+ qts. of oil, you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up. will this company stand by its product like that? i doubt it... for a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you're worried about gunk... it's a scam..",0
"the oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. and the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil. maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? a small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil.",1
"gimmick.there are a number of rerouting oil change kits available. why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail? the oil filter seals itself very well on most engines. while it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles, i wouldn't risk hose failure for a little convenience. on my toyota truck i discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter. i'm not sure that many people even change their own oil. it's cheaper to take it to the toyota dealer, 29.95 and they even rotate the tires.",0
"sediment and metal particles settle in the bottom of your drain pan and these kits can't siphon all that out.  most ""quickie-lube"" stations that pioneered this process have abandoned it because they were getting sued for damaging the engine.  the right way to change your oil is to run your engine until hot and and drain from the bottom; that does a much better job of removing the sludge",0
"i purchased two of these, both coffee makers arrived without an instruction manual, not that you really need one.   the outside of the box says have coffee in a few minutes, i guess it depends who defines a few minutes.   both makers took 20 minutes to heat just one cup of water.  to make a pot, that would be 100 minutes.   i am returning as i am definitely disappointed",0
it was not as advertised. it did not come with the lighter power cord. i am returning it because that is why i bought it. i need a back lit display so that i can see it at night. this will not stay on because it is battery powered only,1
"i own a black '02 jetta tdi and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. i'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. the nxt gen tech wax isn't one of them. one requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. the nxt box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but i'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. in that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. but the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. i waxed my car with nxt, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. i went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. the sun was shining, and as soon as i walked outside and looked at my car, i could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. i did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. i borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. when i got back home, i used alchol to remove the nxt, returned the nxt to the store, got some eagle one nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. good riddance to nxt",1
"this piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. problem is, after i had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps both snapped. now they can't grip on the battery terminals. under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. great idea, shoddy construction. all vector have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.",0
"this is the second accu-gauge tire pressure gauge i have purchased.  the first had very good accuracy and lasted about 3 years.  this one, when compared to three other digital gauges, always shows about 3-4 lbs. less pressure.",0
"this product preys on the paranoia created by sensationalist newscasts and talk shows.  tv convinces you there's a real chance you might find yourself underwater in your car, and now whoever manufactures this makes a killing.  i'll put it in a drawer with my sars facemask, my whole life insurance policy, and that replacement plan best buy just tried to sell me on a twenty-dollar pair of headphones.  i'm sure this thing works as advertised, and i'm just as sure you'll never need to find out.",1
"having read reviews that the fluorescent bulb was dim, i was careful to purchase the led model.  however, it is also dim.  barely produces enough light to keep me from tripping in my shed, not enough to distinguish tools and definitely not a work light.  very disappointing.  after several days of charging i turned it on and only 4 of the 5 leds lit.  i did not purchase from amazon.  went in round and round discussions with retailer and manufacturer about warranty replacement.  retailer would only replace if whole unit returned within 30 days, but after all the trouble to mount solar panel on roof i didn't want to take that down.  turns out there is no warranty.  product guide says to consult retailer for warranty service, retailer says they don't do it.  finally got a replacement but was not refunded shipping and insurance.  if you do purchase this product, my advice is to charge it up before mounting anything to test it",0
"after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed, in plain view of the sun, the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again. after the effort i put in carefully mounting the unit i'm very disappointed and don't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work.",0
forget using this in a shed as the light is hardly bright enough to see your hand in front of your face.  it doesn't hold a charge for longer than a few hours (the unit i received stayed on for about one hour and the box stated three hours).  this information was no where to be found on the website.i purchased this item to use in my chicken coop and had anticipated that i would be able to leave it turned on at all times.  my plan was that it would recharge during the day and stay illuminated during the night.  not possible with this unit as it can't charge the battery at all if it's left turned on.  in addition the unit i received had been previously used and returned by someone else (obvious from the packaging that it had been used before)... so i'm not the only one who thought this was worthless.save your money and try a different product,1
"i was looking for something like this for months.  it was a new product on amazon when i did a froogle search.  installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when i turned on the light i was disappointed.  my 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. not much more light than what my lawn lights put out.  during the past two months i've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time.  after being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died.  i haven't even begun to look for a new one.  very disappointe",0
"when the factory-charged batteries ran out the solar panel would not charge the light.  this was a fluorescent version.  the replacement unit- quickly sent by amazon -was led.  the same case and everything but with bright leds inside.  i liked it much better than the fluorescent one.    the second unit charged and worked very well until the charge was depleted.  then the leds would start blinking.  like an emergency light.  sunforce said that this was not normal behavior.  i returned it as well.  the light will stay up for around two hours, charge quickly but the blinking made it unfit for continuous use.  a nice product but quallity needs to be improved",1
well i bought two of these... i put it in my car in less then a week both of them ripped in the middle area... i expected it to last a little longer??-_- i guess ill try sewing it back together or somethin,0
i received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). i came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem i know not to waste my money. they are very unique and i do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality,1
"...if i can see what i'm buying?please, add a picture",1

"we were expecting more of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving.  it would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling.  as for ""king size"" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it..",1
i'd give this a zero if allowed. easily leaks from both twist caps. any money i saved by changing my oil was spent on degreaser and paper towels cleaning my garage floor,1
"this product works great for draining your car's crankcase oil. it has a screen to catch the drain plug. however, the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a piece of crap. you are supposed to tighten it down, then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal. the large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half-inch too far makes no seal at all. it falls off when you tip the unit to drain, emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor. this is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well",1
"whoever is marketing this should be whipped with razor wire. do not buy, unless you enjoy wasting your money",1
"this product is absolutely worthless, especially in the hot texas summer.  the pitifully weak fan does not cool the car one bit.  it is still blazing hot when you get inside.  don't waste your money on this over-hyped piece of garbage.  better to leave your windows down or park under a tree",0
this product is not worth the money.  it does not keep the car cool and was a waste of my money.  beware of products that only make money for the inventor,0
too hard to follow the instructions . i bought it for my mom who said she could not tell the difference. i am not sure she followed the instructions.i am just assuming  (she is an english professor )it didnt work too well.,0

"i suggest that you do a search on this product on infomercial scams dot com.take a look at this review from channel 2 (kdka) in pittsburgh, pa:you've probably seen the ad on tv for auto cool - it's supposed to keep your parked car cooler.but does it really do that? wouldn't it be great if there was a way to keep your parked car cool?diane black knows all too well the misery of climbing into a hot car. ""i am a visiting nurse. i'm in and out of the car all day,"" black said. ""i hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. so i thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing.""after shipping and handling, $23 for auto cool as seen on tv. the same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car. but does it really do that?on a hot day last week, we decided to find out. inside the auto cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping.the only thing you need is a pair of scissors.now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun.we choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches.the solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. no problem there. we hang it on the window, fan side in.next comes the weather stripping.so we've installed auto cool. now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees.while we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction.one hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car.we are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. it just got hotter inside. but just to be fair, we test one more car.we make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. this time, it's 80 degrees.we quickly install auto cool. by now, the temperature is 90 degrees. while diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. she says it will take about 20 minutes. in the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car.will it work this time? twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees.maybe if we hadn't used auto cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care. not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far.don't waste your money on this one.",1
"very excited to get an alarm at a good deal with free shipping but that all changed when i tried installing two beeps and then nothing i have spent over an hour of tring to get this to work and i tried new fuses but ""no go"" to sum it up the two orginal beeps is all i got from this product besides stress. no go",0

""no problem"" thinks i, ""i do believe i have been carrying a solution to this very problem right here in the trunk!"".  open the trunk, pull out the ""fix a flat"" (ha!) only to find it frozen solid.  now, what use does something like this have, whereby you keep it in your car for an emergency only to have it completely useless when you need it most!?  cost me time + $ to put on my spare, haul it to a shop, and have my tire repaired.  this stuff was a waste of money. if you live somewhere where there's actual weather, don't kid yourself with this nonsense",0

"this device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising, but does absolutely nothing it says it does.  the unit is hard to install, for beginners. it is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather. if there is low sunlight, or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows, even factory shading, it does not work. you must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it, and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun??",1
"this product does not cool down the car.  it is too small.  i would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks.  if you buy this, please do not leave your pets or kids in the car and think that it is safe",1

"i bought this because i have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and i get tired of washing it.  i thought i could use this every other day and get by. however, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  it takes ""bed head"" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  after a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.i use it before i take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  then i end up washing my hair later",1
"i like jonathan anton & some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  it smelled like swamp water.  his other products smell great.  i don't know what happened to this one.",1
"i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  there must be a quality control problem.  my bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  i was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  what a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :",1
"after using this product, i felt less than fresh.  then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head.  i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money",1

"i saw jonathan on qvc and was really impressed with the claim that the moisturizing conditioner was great for dry/damaged hair.  he also said that his products don't strip the color out of hair like some of the brands on the market.  i color and highlight my hair and wanted something that would protect it.  what a disapointment.  the conditioner bottle is horrible at dispensing even a small amount of conditioner.  i had to remove the lid.  then, it's like paste...doesn't seem to go through the hair..even after 3 minutes.  when i tried to comb my hair out, it was like a birds nest.  i had to put a spray leave in conditioner, by another line, in my hair just to comb through it.  i ordered it from qvc...and it's going back",1

i was very unhappy with the product!  i was given the shampoo for christmas which when washing my hair made little to no suds.  when trying to comb out my hair after shampooing it was like a bees nest and i couldn't possibly get a comb thru it.  thats when i ordered the conditioner which was like cake batter and couldn't get it to come out of the container with really queezing it which made the lettering come off on to your hands and i found some in my hair. i squeeze and bang until i finally get a big lump coming out.  i had watched all of jonathan's reality shows when he was working on creating his products and couldn't wait to try them because they are all natural. i am so disappointed!  i recently saw his show back tv where someone calls him up and says they tried his product and how happy they were and jonathan gets all chocked up.  i was screaming at the tv i was so upset.  the product was not cheap and can't believe i can't use something i spent so much money on.,0
"on a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. you can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top.for value of product, jonathan gets a 1.for quality of product 3.the conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. need to use more than average. the conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. i do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but bed head has a similar product that's been out for a while. for that option i would rather choose bed head for quality and price",1
jonathan should spent more time with scott from zorbitt because the packaging is second rate.  the product itself was subpar also,1

"i spent a lot of money on this product & waited with anticipation for it to arrive. when i applied it, it did nothing to ""create"" curl and didn't even define the curls that i already had. my hair was limp and frizzy by days end. it smelled nice & that's about it. cheap-o suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl",1
"this hairspray was too wet and too stiff.  it ruined my clean, freshly washed hair and made my blonde locks stiff and darker - yuck!!!!i love the voluminizing shampoo & conditioner as well as the voluminizing foam - but when i lightly sprayed the ""finishing"" hair spray- it ruined everything.  i will stick to an areosol hairspray instread of a pump.  sorry jonathan :",0

"run as fast as you can... do not try!  okay, so i bought in to the hype of ""blow out"".  once i saw the ""jonathan"" product line on the shelf, i thought, ""hmmm, how yummy!""  boy, was i disappointed.  the moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  the product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  once applied to the hair, i felt knots forming.  upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  i used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when i rinsed and felt the ""new"" texture of my hair.  i couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until i applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  i'm taking this stuff back and demanding a refund!  i'm going back to my frederick fekkai products immediately",0
"watching the show i thought that jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. for example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of houston, tx it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). my hair looks awful after using it. and the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like mea but it does use three different types of peg, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. this is just as harmful as mea, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. and it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the peg products. since peg is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. even though head and shoulders uses mea i find that that even that works better than this. my hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and i've switched back to the other hair products iv'e been using. it's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. my hair stylist also recommended dove products if you need hydration. don't buy it!",1
"i used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way i want my hair cleaned. not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. people have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. in the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have.jonathan is not the only good product out there. i have been using phyto shampoo from france and kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!!i used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the shampoo. i have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too.",1
"is this shampoo or sap??  what exactly is it supposed to do??  i received a sample of this shampoo and i am ever so glad i got to try it free before i actually spent money on it.  not only did my hair feel like straw, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was so heavy i couldn't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo.  i'll save this one for halloween.",1
"i see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like ""straw"" yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  are you kidding me?  if having ""clean"" hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw, then i'll happily return to having ""dirty"" hair...seriously, i've had smoother, softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner!  i could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! i have rather dry hair, and i merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because i am a fan of jonathan and his show, so i will return to my drugstore shampoo, dove and pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair.",1
"okay, i'll admit. i bought into the hype. oooo, no ""sulfates""... oooo, ""essential water"".... oooo, ""all natural"" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - ""vegan"" shampoo and conditioner...i headed into the shower with confidence that i had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. and what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely ""dessicant"" shampoo. and no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! i tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. after 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than i was, i returned the product.this product truly deserves 0 stars!!",1
"i was excited to purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons of blow out.  unfortunately, i was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair.  my hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess.unfortunately, the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it",1
"i purchased this item after seeing jonathan's show.  as much as i enjoyed his program, i am sorry to say that this product is just terrible.  it weighed down my hair, and made my hair look greasy before i was even done styling!  the day after using the product, my hair looked like an oil slick!  i do wish jonathan much success, but these products need a lot of work.  very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard",0
my naturally curly hair is thinning and i thought this conditioner would be helpful. the conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. i thought it was too drippy. i nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. i would not recommend this conditioner,1
this foam product by jonathan is okay.  the reviews on his products are highly overrated.  the price doesn't bother me at all.  there are better foams for thin and limp hair,1
"this product totally frizzed out my hair. i had been having good luck for once with paul mitchell's foaming mousse. this jonathan product,sadly, rather than taming my hair, induced the frizz. a lot. perhaps a stronger formula is needed, or maybe i just don't have fine, limp enough hair i was very sad",1
this product works well when i use it with a curling iron.  the low rating is for the cost.  i just don't think it is worth over $20,1
product made my hair sticky and gooey. i am a personal fan of his and it got rushed to market.  needs re formulatin,1
"i have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. i bought the t3 tourmaline with great excitement. come on - its 200$, the most i have ever used on a hairdryer. i did not reduce my hair drying time at all, but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..but all in all- too much money for too little help!nor",1
"i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. but i'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. ""most ionic and infrared"" is gibberish. tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. i'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam",0
"i have dyed red hair, a lot of dyed red hair. this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair. will not purchase again",0
"i bought this lipgloss at my local sephora store. first of all..do not expect to see any plumping what so ever. it makes no difference in how your lips look. secondly, it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball. the only reason this gloss is $18 is because of the too faced name brand. dont waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good/better for a few bucks at the drugstor",1
"i would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. the roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out, and you find yourself rolling it over & over again to get a decent amount of gloss. the gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) and it does taste & smell delicious. but it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. i would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. it would make a great product",1
"bought this to help myself achieve some punch with my existing waves.  all i got were crimps in wierd places.  found the instruction booklet completely not useful.  i tried and tried but could not produce anything remotely close to a wave, curl etc.  save your money",1
"i previously left a very positive review of the shampoo and conditioner, however, after using it for several days, my hair feels heavy, dirty and coated with something.  i know jonathan loves his product ""dirt"" but it does not belong in a volumizing product for women with fine, limp hair.  i don't need anything else to weight my hair down.  it does not feel clean after washing and drying it.  i am quite disappointed as i really loved the way both products smelled. i had to wash my hair a second time today because it would not do what i wanted it to do and it felt like the ""second day"" after washing it. i still recommend the volumizing foam.  that is a nice product.  smells wonderful and does not weight your hair down or cause it to become full of static as products with a lot of alcohol do.",1
"not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...stop..you hair feels very damaged.  it goes back to normal texture if i use my other shampoos.  i made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the jonathan shampoo..and it was.  it went into the trash.  don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look",0

"after the debacle that was dirt i tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny.  well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty.  is this a joke.  i am sure that jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here i am trying to wash this out of my hair, with his very shampoo and all i have is tears. clearly this is not product without tears.",1
"if you want your hair to feel like it has day old elementary school vanilla pudding in your hair then this is a 5 star product for ya!  if you like your hair clean and nice, pass on this.  i tried this, and my god anything i rested my head on; chairs, car seats, pillows, my boyfriend, my child! was left with a greasy gooey stain on it.  seriously  i think this stuff is going to cost me more in cleaning bills then anything else i have ever used on my body.  and i still have the original hair damage in my dern hair!!!  maybe if he had killed an animal or 2 for this product i would not be left with this mess.",1
"i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time, because i have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  it ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  my hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  then when i was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.",1
i received this as a gift.  i was thrilled with the results the first few times i used it.  then the little red light went out while i was straightening my hair and it has never worked since.  i only got to use it three times,1
"i bought this product at sephora.  i had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  when i tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  i took it back to sephora for an exchange since i was still within the 30 day exchange period.  the second one worked for about two months...then the same thing happened.  i was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  this product is horrible.  i never dropped it or anything like that.  in fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, i would place it back in the box it came in.  i am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  honestly, i wanted a good flat iron and i thought this was a good product because it was expensive...big mistake.  my friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  she also straightens her hair a lot more often than i do.  i don't know why i didn't ask her where she got hers.  please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  if you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.",1
"this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  it did straighten my hair, but that was all.  i had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this t3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.",1
"on my third use, i set it down on the carry case and it sizzled. i looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord, right where it is connected to the handle! i immediately unplugged it, and now there's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out. i am so grateful i wasn't using it on my hair when this happened! what with the straightening balm i was using and everything, my hair could've easily started on fire",1
"i tried doing a patti labelle do, where my hair stood up at an angle and it fell over all limp and oily.  my hair felt dirtier than when i put dirt in it",0
"this was terrible - i tried getting my weave shaped like a helicopter for my prom, but it turn out looking like a melting ceiling fan. like in ""something about mary,"" splooge would have been cheaper, and would have held bettah.",1
i have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of k-y jelly - frankly i am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams.,1
"i saw jonathan on qvc and was really impressed with the claim that the moisturizing conditioner was great for dry/damaged hair.  he also said that his products don't strip the color out of hair like some of the brands on the market.  i color and highlight my hair and wanted something that would protect it.  what a disapointment.  the conditioner bottle is horrible at dispensing even a small amount of conditioner.  i had to remove the lid.  then, it's like paste...doesn't seem to go through the hair..even after 3 minutes.  when i tried to comb my hair out, it was like a birds nest.  i had to put a spray leave in conditioner, by another line, in my hair just to comb through it.  i ordered it from qvc...and it's going back",1
"jonathan conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner. jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff, you can't fool them twice. i know we will all be seeing jonathan product on the clearence rack in a big lots with in a year or two",0
i was very unhappy with the product!  i was given the shampoo for christmas which when washing my hair made little to no suds.  when trying to comb out my hair after shampooing it was like a bees nest and i couldn't possibly get a comb thru it.  thats when i ordered the conditioner which was like cake batter and couldn't get it to come out of the container with really queezing it which made the lettering come off on to your hands and i found some in my hair. i squeeze and bang until i finally get a big lump coming out.  i had watched all of jonathan's reality shows when he was working on creating his products and couldn't wait to try them because they are all natural. i am so disappointed!  i recently saw his show back tv where someone calls him up and says they tried his product and how happy they were and jonathan gets all chocked up.  i was screaming at the tv i was so upset.  the product was not cheap and can't believe i can't use something i spent so much money on.,0
"on a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. you can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top.for value of product, jonathan gets a 1.for quality of product 3.the conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. need to use more than average. the conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. i do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but bed head has a similar product that's been out for a while. for that option i would rather choose bed head for quality and price",1
jonathan should spent more time with scott from zorbitt because the packaging is second rate.  the product itself was subpar also,1
"used along with shampoo theory, my hair turned out worse than it ever had.  not recommended, at least for medium/wavy hair.  no frizz control",0
"unless you have a new softball glove to break in, this product is not for you. way, way too much oil.  just nappy. i might as well have put mayo in my hair.",1

""most ionic and infrared"" is gibberish. tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. i'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam",0
"i bought this because i have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and i get tired of washing it.  i thought i could use this every other day and get by. however, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  it takes ""bed head"" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  after a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.i use it before i take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  then i end up washing my hair later",1
"i like jonathan anton & some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  it smelled like swamp water.  his other products smell great.  i don't know what happened to this one.",1
"i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  there must be a quality control problem.  my bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  i was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  what a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :",1
"after using this product, i felt less than fresh.  then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head.  i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money",1
"i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel ""fresh"".  in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it.",0
"i tried doing a patti labelle do, where my hair stood up at an angle and it fell over all limp and oily.  my hair felt dirtier than when i put dirt in it",0
"this was terrible - i tried getting my weave shaped like a helicopter for my prom, but it turn out looking like a melting ceiling fan. like in ""something about mary,"" splooge would have been cheaper, and would have held bettah.",1
i have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of k-y jelly - frankly i am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams.,1
"this product did not live up to jonahan's ""claims"" on the bottle.i cannot even begin to describe how bad it was and how it did not work nor live up to his promise",0
"i had high hopes for this stuff. i have watched blow out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but i cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. i have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. i will stick to my frederic fekkai products-they actually work",1
"i spent a lot of money on this product & waited with anticipation for it to arrive. when i applied it, it did nothing to ""create"" curl and didn't even define the curls that i already had. my hair was limp and frizzy by days end. it smelled nice & that's about it. cheap-o suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl",1
"okay, i'll admit. i bought into the hype. oooo, no ""sulfates""... oooo, ""essential water"".... oooo, ""all natural"" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - ""vegan"" shampoo and conditioner...i headed into the shower with confidence that i had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. and what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely ""dessicant"" shampoo. and no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! i tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. after 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than i was, i returned the product.this product truly deserves 0 stars!!",1
"i was excited to purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons of blow out.  unfortunately, i was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair.  my hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess.unfortunately, the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it",1
"i purchased this item after seeing jonathan's show.  as much as i enjoyed his program, i am sorry to say that this product is just terrible.  it weighed down my hair, and made my hair look greasy before i was even done styling!  the day after using the product, my hair looked like an oil slick!  i do wish jonathan much success, but these products need a lot of work.  very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard",0
my naturally curly hair is thinning and i thought this conditioner would be helpful. the conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. i thought it was too drippy. i nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. i would not recommend this conditioner,1
"....comes hefty disappointment. andis is a good brand of clipper, ""however"" $80 for this pair of clippers is $70 too much. the power is weak and it takes about 24 hours to fully charge. these clippers are not designed for professional use at all. i am not a barber, my wife cuts my hair every 2 weeks or so. it does a decent fade job and my 2 boys(3 and 4) are mixed and seems to cut through their hair with a little more ease than mine. however it seems that my past corded clippers had more power which translate to easier cutting and trimming. my wife has to constantly go over various spots multiple times because it did not hit the spot the first or 2nd time.my recommendation is to do your research and go with another pair of andis clippers, stay away from this pair, or you'll be finding yourself writing a review saying i agree with the first guy that reviewed this product",0
"all of the ""glowing"" and ""raving"" reviews of this product were all entered on april 24 or april 25.  coincidence?  i think not.  these are people paid by strivectin for their ""honest"" reviews...",1
"i bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work. well it doesn't. i followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever. i'm 24, 23 when i tried the product... no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all. if it doesn't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff. i wish i hadn't listened to the raves on this product",1
i find it strangely odd that everyone who gave this product a fantastic review:1. has only ever reviewed one product on amazon  2. all seem to have been posted on the 24th. caveat emptor,1
"i bought the cream hoping to get rid of, or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy.  i have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results.  it smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts.  i was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews.  i'm now very disappointed.  if something sounds too good to be true, it is",0
"i used to love curious. i asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion. however, a few months after i got it, it started to smell funny... over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it. when i opened the bottle i gaged at the stench. i poured it down the sink and it was yellow. i do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please don't buy it with the atomizer. the lotion still smells good.",1
"like many others, my perfume turned yellow as well. i think it only happens with the atomizer. perhaps exposure to air soured the perfume. i am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good. the product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set. i am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf-life. i am never buying perfume from britney spears. obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume.",1
"i immediately fell in love with the fragrance, and my husband bought me the really big bottle.  i wanted to savor it, and make it last.  much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol.  it also formed a nasty, crusty substance all over the pump and bottle.  i am soooo disappointed!!!",0
"i received my curious perfume not last christmas, but the christmas before.. and i was so excited, i had already been through the shops at least 15 times just trying it on over and over, using every tester i could find.when i got it, i was just as happy and used it just *so* carefully, i wanted it to last for years. i got the one that comes with the pump, the largest bottle.... anyway, i now look over to my dresser and see it sitting there. yellow.my curious perfumewentyellowand apparently mine was not the only one that went bright yellow, my brothers girlfriends is also a lovely urine coloured yellow. it also grew a sticky coat of curious smelling...crud.. around the bottle and just today i went over to it, only to find it leaking all over my table... i squeeze the pump and it is rock hard... i look over to the nozzle and it is covered in a thick crust, the whole thing has crusted over and is leaking, i squeezed it again and  my curious perfume  splerted out..it now smells offand doesn't really look all that fantastic as you may have guessed.i am disgusted and so so angrythat perfume i wanted so bad and was so excited to get now sits on the table surrounded by it's own disgusting pool of crust and leaking hardened perfume (i didn't even know that was possible) i am disgustedwhat a cheap nasty nasty product.do not buy it unless you think you're going to use it within a period of 1 year.good work!a product as cheap and nasty as the person endorsing it",1
"when curious came out, i smelled it and had to buy it. i acknowledged at the time that the bottle was probably half of the reason i bought it (unfortunately). the bottle is beautiful and attracts many customers by itself. the fragrance is very pretty and sweet. it goes on very strong but fades quickly, which it annoying. also, maybe six months after i bought it, i noticed that it started smelling a little different. i left it in my bathroom for a while without moving it because of the difference. today, i picked the bottle up and the sprayer was covered in this ....disgusting filmy substance, which had also dripped down the sides of the bottle and created a ring of filth on my countertop. it was really really gross. by the looks of it, the perfume had some sort of chemical reaction with the metal from the nozzle of the sprayer. anyways, the whole bottle smells awful now and it's digusting. the bottle design was it's awful putrid demise, which ruined $50. it's really unfortunate too, because i loved the bottle and the fragrance when i got it and now it's junk",0
"i had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. not so. the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.i have used many creams. so far art of shaving is the best. casswell massey is ok as is aveda. avoid truefitt",1
"omg - if you decide to use this use it sparingly!!!!  i can't stress it enough.  i decided to get the philosophy acne kit because i had a few minor breakouts and clogged pores.  i had been using clean & clear salicylic (sp?) acid products with no trouble so figured this wouldn't be much different.  boy was i wrong!  the first week was great; week #2 the nightmare began... i wound up these huge, brownish-red, sore, swollen, itchy bumps/scabs on my face.  i have since stopped that portion of the treatment and am now moisturizing my face back to health.  last night my bf said it looks better than the 'pizza face' from the philosophy products.  yikes!  try at your own risk but take it slow",1
omg my face..i had 5 zit i put one drop of stuff on each and there was a slight burning sensation for a while.. and when i woke up the next morning all the spots were huge and brown looking..it looked like brown moles or something..when i washedmy face with dial and a wash cloth those spots started to bleed!! im on the phone with a represenative now im sooo angry i even canceled work because i look hideous now i have 3 bright red spots and / 2 are still brown  open-sore-spots on my face and im devastated..i had never tried this before but read the reviews and thought it would be perfect..this is not the case buyer beware!!,1
"never had i been so unhappy with my makeup as i was when i was using clinique. i used stay beige (which i lightly patted on my face on top of clinique's superfit liquid makeup - i have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. i also hated how clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that i had to settle for honey in the liquid and beige in the powder. as much as i went back to macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced i was making a big deal out of nothing. instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which i shouldn't have to do in the first place) i just switched to a different makeup line: laura mercier, which i am very happy with.i've had many other friends who were unhappy with clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. i'm not trying to knock the product. i'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people i know. i would definitely not recommend clinique to anyone. i'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.",1
"i just purchased the small bottle(thank god) of the ojon ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  it seems like it made my hair a little softer, but the smell is horrendous.  i have gotten the worst headache from the smell of this product. so overall it may make my hair feel softer, but there is no way i will put this stuff on my head again.  the rest is going in the trash",0
i got this product as a sample.  it has the worst scent ever.  it took me 2 days of washing to get the horrible smell out of my hair,0
"i do not like this shampoo at all. in fairness, i did give it two stars because it may not be good for coarse african american hair. it seemed to make my hair clump together and made it difficult to comb through when wet. the one thing that did detangle it however was the ojon hydrating conditioner which i do love.  did have a pleasant scent and foamed up well",1
this thing was such a waste.  it does not get cold enough to do anything.  it also won't stay flat against your face to give any soothing sensation to your eyes. overpriced and worthless item,0
"i can't believe how much amazon and other retail stores (like sephora)charge for this.  i buy prevage md (which is double the strength of regular prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and i only pay 120$.  why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff?  if you don't want to go to the doctor to buy the md version, then you can get it off ebay for around 100$..",1
"i bought this product in the color paparazzi from sephora - online, i read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines.  i was very disappointed when i finally got it and tried it. there is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13.  i could not wear this to work or even an evening out as i would feel like a clown.  the only place this would look semi-good at would be a nightclub where it is dark. i was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter.  i do not recommend this product at all. i also returned this promptly back to sephora.",1
"not really impressed with this product. it applies okay, but the colors look really bright and odd on. the colors do fade over time and i do not recommend this product. i like lancome's eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice",1
"i was excited to try out this product, given all the rave reviews. but after just 2 uses my face broke out in a rash! it's awful! and i do not have sensitive skin by any stretch of the imagination. i would not recommend this product.",0
"i have thick, wavy hair and this product did nothing but make it feel wirey and frizzy. i don't think it is worth the money when i have found other poducts (such as redken) that work better and cost less",1
"i was looking forward to receiving this body lotion; however was very disappointed when i opened it and smelled the fragrance.it smells exactly like paint.  then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint-like scent.i will not buy any more philosophy products.  the less expensive fragrances/lotions are so much better that you buy from target, wal-mart, etc",1
"i love falling in love fragrance and the shower gel, but this lotion is not getting as much love from me. it doesn't smell the same to me, and on a bad day, makes me a little sick.  it's sweeter smelling.  thing is, i need lotion, and i don't want competing scents.  otherwise, i might have rated it even lower",0
i'm all about lip plumping glosses and this one sucked.  it has a really slippery constistancy and did not plump my lis at all.  i'll stick with my too faced lip injection products,0
"actually, i would give the product 5 stars, and the packaging a minus-2. citylips really does work, plumping and hydrating; it does required repeated applications. but the packaging results in about 10-12% of the (expensive) material being completely unavailable!  worse, if you try to wiggle the (too-short) applicator in order to get the last 10%, the container breaks at the neck (actually, one came already cracked in my case!).  true, they do offer some colors at 2/3 price, but most effective is to apply clear, and go outside the lipline-and the clear almost never has gone on sale!",1
"works as a good lip balm but i didt really see a difference in the size of my lips, wouldnt buy it again.",1
"i used two tubes in one month - one for daytime wear, and one for nighttime and when i wasn't going out (clear).  i like the product: how it looks and smoothes out my lips, but i just cannot afford to pay $60 a month on my lips!  if they lower the price by $10-12, i will buy it again......but not until they do :-",0
"i am so disappointed!!!!!!!!!!! i ordered this scent after hearing about it from friends, and reading great reviews.  all of the reviews i read mentioned the lack of staying power that this product has, but i never expected the product to be so extraordinarily weak.  don't get me wrong, i do not want my fragrance to enter a room before i do (after all, it is not the 80's anymore lol), but i also do not want to have to sniff my wrist so hard to detect the scent that i take off skin!  the scent is beautiful, i would love to wear it!  but 20 minutes after i sprayed it on, i could barely detect the fragrance.  as sometimes it is harder to ""smell your own perfume"", i asked my hubby and friends for their opinions.  they could barely smell it either.  i would happily wear this scent every day if i could enjoy it at all.  if philosophy can create this scent with staying power, they will have a customer for life.  as it stands now, i would not recommend anyone buy this product.  it is a very disappointing waste of money",1
"i am such a huge fan of the philosophy grace line that i thought i would really love this, too.  i find that it is much too light for me.  it does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice, but it doesn't last long at all.  i guess i'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice i'm wearing it.  nobody has said anything so far.  the shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes...wonderful lather, but no smell to speak of.  i will stick with amazing grace, baby grace and pure grace.  those are wonderful",1
"i bought two clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  the trouble started occurring about two months after using.  one brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!my experience with the customer service has been terrible.  they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!",0
"this perfume deserves negative stars. i was in macy's when i saw this fragrance on the dior counter. the bottle is gorgeous, and i really like hypnotic poison and miss dior cherie, so i figured i would give this one a try. i really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin. it is horrible. white floral scents are generally not my thing, but i can usually tolerate them. this was the worst perfume i ever smelled. it's way too powdery and it smells so cheap. i was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze. disgusting. not worth the money at all. if you want to buy this scent, i would recommend buying dove deodorant spray instead. it's much cheaper and smells exactly the same. i wonder if it really is the dove deodorant but repackaged...hmm..",0
"at first, it's a beautiful floral scent, then it dries to something that gives me a headache.  i cannot detect what smell it is, but it's not pleasant.  i cannot detect vanilla in this at all.",0
"i was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the reviews, but the list of ingredients sounded wonderful so i gave it a try.  i love it!  it's surprising.  it changes.  on me, when i first put it on it takes on a white floral scent.  when i first applied it, i was surprised that it seemed like a floral"".. but hours later i was smelling vanilla.  i was very surprised to realize it was me!  very interesting! very cool!  lighter than the original poison, it may become my spring/summer choice",1
"it doesn't smell woody to me at all. well, maybe a fake, pinesol-type of smell. it smells really artificial and almost chemical-y. i guess it's not so bad, and some people might like it, but i didn't",1
"i loved the smell in the magazines so i decided to get it.  well...it was good at first...and then i got tired.  it smells a little cheap and sort of like pine.  i sometiems use it, but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits (that's what i use it for).  i think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long",1
this item doesn't include everything that is mention in the details.  i wouldn't even pay a dollar for it. don't purchase this item!!!!!!!!!!,1
i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about. i was not impressed. it smells just like ordinary soap-so what? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well. you can get soap that smells better at wal-mart!,1
"i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly/kinky hair. it didn't do anything for my hair and i didn't like the smell (but its not that big of a deal)--i returned it. i don't think its for coarse-kinky curls, but maybe for others textures.  &lt;for coarse 'naturals' try carol's daughter's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line",1
"nanoparticles???? i was in the process of re-ordering this item until i read the description.  apparently you're using the public to ascertan whether or not these nanoparticles are safe.  thanks a lot, lancome!  not on my face!",1
"sorry to say i found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying, something i haven't experienced with other removers.     in addition, it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish.        on the plus side, it's fragrance free and reasonable in price",1
"i really wanted to like this but i find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours. when i went back to get a lighter color, it did the same. i think there's just too much yellow in this foundation. and considering it's oil-free, it didn't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday.i would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you. or if you're looking for a similar oil-free foundation, i would highly recommend laura mercier oil-free or chanel dpf",1
"as much as i love fat girl slim, i thought i'd try serious cellulite soap to go with it. i was not impressed at all. it has a terrible medicine like smell that lingers on you and after a few washes there are no more dimples on the soap. it was what i thought it would be at all. the size of the bar was good, the price is good, but i am not pleased at all with the quality",0
"the texture of this cleanser is waxy.  i could barely get it off my face, and i broke out badly after using it.  i double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser, and that i hadn't mistakenly put some other product on my face.  it smells wonderful, though.  i tried to think of alternate uses for the product, but finally threw it away",1
i was so excited to try this product from all of the great reviews that i read on it- boy where they wrong. i used this product for 2 months and saw no difference in my skin at all. i have used a lot of products and would have to rate this down at the bottom of my list- especially for how much it cost,1
i haven't had an outbreak of acne in about 5 years until i started using this cream. i kept using it thinking that my huge cysts couldn't possibly be from this very pricey stuff. i went to the dermo and she said to stay away from these thick creams specifically for anti-aging because they are horrible for your skin. i went back to my cheap neutrogena lotion for anti- aging and it felt sooo much better and lighter and within a week my skin cleared up. i didn't even realize how very thick this stuff was until i started back on my neutrogena. i feel so bad about the $$$ i lost and i wish i would've gotten a sample first. i encourage you to do the same.,0
"i was very unhappy with this product. first the shipping took way too long. second, the tube is much smaller than sold at macy's and the cost is more. and the contents were gross, very goopy. not smooth. like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. i'll fight the mall to buy this next time",0
"i love, love, love, lipglass normally.  but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go-go dancer.",1
"my sister-in-law bought this product for me after i had admired the shade (purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. i have used other mac products before with great results, but was very dissapointed with this product. first of all, i gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. however, this product is sticky. very sticky! it does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. when i wear a lip gloss, i want to be soft and smooth feeling. i want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. this will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  this product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, i would never reccomend this to anyone",1
"i hate to say this since philosophy is one of my favorite brands, but this is probably the worst mascara i have ever used. it clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove. it does not simply wash off, it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink. about half of them remain attached to your lashes, and i've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara. everything else i've ever tried from philosophy was fantastic, but the best mascara out there, hands down, is from lancome",0
"this clarifying lotion is too harsh. i used it once and my skin is itchy, dry and red. i think i'm allergic to it. basically, the chemicals in these products are really harmful. most of the time, people don't need these products. all they do is clog up what nature has given us. this lotion is horrible",0
"i purchased the entire 3-step clinique system including: clinique facial soap with dishclinique clarifying lotion 2clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotionabout the same time i started using the clinique 3-step system, i began wearing foundation for the first time. i found that my skin started breaking out and began to be dry in some spots. i stopped using the foundation after about 3 months because i thought that was the issue. however, my skin problems did not improve and i even moved down a level in the clinique system to one for more sensitive skin.however, after about 7 months of daily use, my skin was not improving and i found a review of the clinique 3-step system from paula begoun. her research indicates that all of clinique's facial soaps in the 3-step system are too irritating for all skin types. her research also stated that all clarifying lotions (1-4) contain alcohol and clarifying lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating for all skin types. i never thought that my skin care products were the cause of my flaky skin and break outs. apparently, the products dried out my skin making it flaky in some areas and in response, my skin started producing more oil to compensate for the dryness-which made me break out in other areas. i switched to paula's choice facial products and i occasionally use cetaphil. after i made the switch, my skin slowly began recovering. unfortunately, now i have some acne scars on my cheeks as a result of using the clinique 3-step system. it makes me sad because before, my skin was healthy and for the most part clear. i do want to be fair to clinique. they have some great products---i use their city block sheer spf 15, advanced stop signs eye spf 15 and i wear clinique happy perfume which smells amazing. i hope this review proves helpful to other women so you don't have to go through what i went through! clinique does have some great products in their line, but they do need to  reformulate their 3-step skin care system.",1
"i'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes.  i seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing.  yes the scent is great, i love it.  but the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me.  really really disapointed.  i guess i'm just used to the channel and ralph lauren lines.  they are quality and can last most of the day.  this stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days.",1
i like the smell of this fragrance very much but have trouble with the sprayer mister.  maybe i just have a defective one but i need to unscrew the top and dab it on,0
"the key to my heart lipgloss chain is a very cute, original idea, but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the hard candy name. the reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. all very true. i got my keychain in the pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and i was feeling pretty cool about it. however, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it. now, i've always been a fairly careful person, i'm not klutzy nor do i drop or lose things. my keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, i never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. the first time i was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, i only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because i saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo. how did it come apart like this? i honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. i can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. it was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. this is not the way to go for gloss on your keys",1
"i love the smell of this perfume. however, it doesn't stay on. i have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem. i was sold by sjp on this perfume when she appeared on oprah. loved it when i went to the counter at the mall to check it out. i have been using it for about 2 months now and it just doesn't last. about an hour after i put it on i (or my husband) can't smell it anymore. trust me, i learned to apply it liberally and it still doesn't stay. totally disappointed",1
"as some people before me said already, this scent isn't that lovely. i am a sjp-fan, and i was almost certain i would love the new perfume of this stylish lady.it isn't released yet in holland, but i found a sample in germany where it is already released. i was disappointed. the smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something i would like to smell like. it isn't lovely at all. it is too sporty. i expected something more flowery. the scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. so, although i am a sjp-fan, i wouldn't like to smell like her. a pity.my favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): beyond paradise (estee lauder), curious (britney spears), couture! (moschino), live (j.lo), tumulte (christian lacroix), several escade limited edition perfumes and gucci rush 2",0
"after hearing oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her favorite things for 2005, i thought for sure i'd love it.  i ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  i just had to see for myself...well, i was not impressed.  the scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to ""catch"" in my throat.  i accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings i could still smell it.  i guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing.anyway, i think this perfume is too ""old lady"" for my taste.  it reminded me of j. lo's glow.  which i also have and don't like.for comparisons sake, perfumes i do like are britney spears' curious, clinique happy, escada island kiss and lucky you",1
"i bought this eyeliner expecting great things, and was sorely disappointed.  application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and i can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof).  if you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you.  i prefer a softer line, so this didn't.also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day.i'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring.  i didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but i did have flakes, so i'm still not happy with it.this is definitely not worth the pricetag",0
"my husband was revolted by the smell of this product.  i have bad sinuses, so it didn't bother me.  as far as effectiveness goes, there are no miracle ingredients in this concoction.  i used it everyday, several times a day, and noticed no lasting improvement in the look or feel of the skin on my hands.  at a cost of almost $20 for 8.5oz., i got skunked",1
"shiseido is known for creating top quality products that do not irritate even the most sensitive of skin. my mother and many of my friends mothers swear by their benefiance line.  i cannot tell you how disappointed i am in their pureness line. it is for oily/problem skin.  i have been using this for about 10 days and while it goes on nicely and has this wonderful, light, clean fragrance, it had made my skin even oilier.  i thought my skin just had to get acclimated to a new skincare regimen but this is not the case",1
"i'm a huge fan of the majority of the philosophy line, along with adoring the amazing grace scent!  i thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent.  boy was i wrong!!  if you love amazing grace, this smells nothing like it.  it smells like plastic flowers.. not appealing at all.  even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic.  if you want a fantastic exfoliator, try gingerbread man or the margarita scrub.. those are devine!  i think i'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on",1
this scrub didn't moisturize my skin at all. and the salt stings! it seems like it is more of a cleanser than anything and the scent is boring,1
i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about. i was not impressed. it smells just like ordinary soap-so what? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well. you can get soap that smells better at wal-mart!,1
"this is one of the cutest shower caps i've owned, but it didn't keep my hair dry -- the cap kept sliding up my head.  sephora's shower cap also did the same thing, but, at least, it only cost $5. so far, i've found the best shower caps are the complimentary ones i receive when i occasionally stay in a hotel.",1
"the philosophy states on their cosmetic's containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin. well, this is for sure true, when you use this kit kit. i have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using acne kit kit not even one acne spot dissapeared. i'm combining it with oxygen peel- this doesn't help either. i was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum. all they do ( maybe except of the wash) is drying out the skin. soon i have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough i was using an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone. i dont get it- i was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line of cosmetics. for the same price i could have bought stuff that really works-the one that vanessa williams is happy with. i know cause i tried it, didn't make my skin feel like sahara and will be my next choice. save your money. p.s. the oxygen peel is o.k. dough",1
"i sprayed a tester sheet at a perfume counter with this scent.  after shopping a bit, i went back and decided to buy it.  it's nice and light, but after wearing it for the first time, i realized it's too light.  i couldn't even smell it when i held my wrist to my nose.  the second time, i decided to apply more.  i must've used 6-7 sprays and still, only a lingering aroma.  for the amount you have to use and the faintness of the scent, i wouldn't recommend it",0
"i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips, it just wont glide. you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em. clinique liners are the worst one in the market",0
"i read the label, and it is not a rare, tropical oil at all, but plain old american palm oil!  false advertising really bothers me.  it did condition my hair well, but i agree that the fragrances (which are added to it, by the way) make the odor very strong and unpleasant.  the price is also very high.  i will not order this again",1
"i bought this stuff from the shopping channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until i went to get my hair colored. the color didn't take!my hair is shoulder length, and i only used the ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry. the color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that i had put the ojon on! the smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the hair spray was disgusting. people remarked that i had overdosed on perfume, so i had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair.i definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair.",0
"i have very dry frizzy hair.this treatment left my hair softer,now my hair is a big soft frizz ball, it added too much body.i like this better for use as a grooming gloss",1
"this is a hit or miss product. i ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating (burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes), the product did work for a while. my extremely dry, curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working. i would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut, jojoba, almond, avocado before shampooing or after. i adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier. if you do want to try the product, ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them.",1
"although it is great others love this product, i did not get that same streak of good luck. i had been using clinique for years, merely because it was affordable and a lot of people i knew used it. however, every time i took pictures i couldn't help but cringe after i saw the way my face looked. i'm a naturally tan person, but when i wore clinique's foundation (i used honey 07) it would make my face look extremely pale and ghostly, compared to the rest of my body. it got to the point where i got so upset that i went back to the clinique counter at macy's and insisted this just couldn't be the right color for me. they insisted it was the correct color and didn't even bother trying new shades on me, even though i had gone back a couple different times. overall, i was really miserable with this product. as a lady, i want to look my best. i definitely don't want to look like someone who doesn't know how to put her makeup on, but whenever i took pictures and saw the way i looked, i couldn't help but think everyone was thinking that. for those of you who may be having my same problem, i recommend switching over to laura mercier. i made the switch and it's been the best makeup decision of my life. my face has never looked better",1
this item smells like lemon pine sol. it is not what you think you are paying for. its not worth the money.,1
"as a rule, i like the seche products.  this polish thinner did not work for me and was a true disappointment.  i wasted my money on this one",0
"i will admit, i am a sucker for hair products. i have very thick hair, that at times, can be a little wild.  i have used fekkai products before, and their okay.  certainly not worth the over inflated price tag.  but i read the reviews for this product and thought it might be the perfect solution for my hair during the winter months.  wrong answer!  this product is very thick, too thick for me to spread through my hair without putting some work into it.  conditioners and hair masks should be well, conditioning.  i left this hair mask in the required 20 minutes, and it did nothing.  in fact, i had to go back through my hair with my $6.00 pantene conditioner just to make my hair manageable.  i also have to wonder what the purpose is of putting pieces of nut shells into a product that is supposed to condition hair?  all those pieces are going to do is rough up your hair cuticle.ladies, spend your money on a book that reviews hair products! i did and i've realized that all hair products are essentially the same.  only the name and perfumes change.  read paula begoun's book about hair products",1
"i have dry, fine, easlily tangled color-treated hair and thought this sounded like the answer. i was surprised to read the other comments since, for me, this just plain didn't work. my hair was as dry and frazzled as before i used it. i have better luck with conditioners that don't have to be left on for nearly as long a time. i recently discovered a great conditioner from my hairdresser called bonacure which works in a few minutes and leaves my hair in great condition, shiny, managable and detangled. and for a mask i tried keratase and it was fantastic and the consistancy made it easier to use and my hair was silky smooth and stronger. i really thought this would be amazing for any type of damaged hair but it wasn't the right choice for me. maybe i would have had more luck with fekkai's glossers",1
"i have been using frederic fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so i thought i would try the luscious curls.  it was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  it left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  when it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  i have used loreal's professional line prior to this and i will definitely go back to it.  it's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls.",1
"another disappointed customer. i have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! before using fekkai's luscious curls lotion, i was using aveda's be curly lotion and matrix's curl.life contouring creme. both of the latter products work very well with my hair. i don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so i just air dry it. without blow drying, whether i'm using aveda or matrix, the results are great! my hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy.i had never used fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. everything luscious curl enhancing lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. in fact, it actually made my hair worst! it became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. in addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. also, i didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. it was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.  because of my very poor experience with fekkai's luscious curls lotion, i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. i think i'll stick to the aveda and matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair.",0
my hair was still frizzy after using this product. :,1
"this product was a waste of good money.  it doesn't even work to control frizz as promised.  the curls are limp and after about an hour or so, there is a lot of frizz.  i would not buy this product again",1
"i've been using this product for almost 2 months and i have seen no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my dark circles.  and yes, it does burn!  the only thing i'm glad about is that i bought it from ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere.  i've had dark under-eye circles all my life.  i suppose i should just learn to live with them and save my money.  i will not be wasting my money on this product again",1
"doesn't really change appearance of eye area. i'm 37 and am starting to get some lines,puffiness and circles, but used product 3weeks and wasn't impressed",0
"i've been using this product for about two weeks now and i haven't seen the slightest change in the dark circles under my eyes. i don't know how long you have to use it before you see a difference, but i don't think it's going to show any change in the dark circles. personally i think i wasted my money. i don't think theres anything on the market that can help dark circles under the eyes.lind",0
"i have sensitive skin and this product burned my skin, leaving burn marks for weeks! finally, i went to the dermatologist who had to prescribe something to help the skin heal. please, check with your doctor first before trying this",1
not goo,1
"i gave it two stars because unlike another anti dht shampoo i tried, this one didn't strip my hair of all oil in one application and make it frizzy.  that is where my praise stops because it smells medicated and funky.to the people that make this stuff:  my hairline is starting to recede and the last thing i need is to reek of funky old guy smell at age 40!  i would rather continue losing my hair than smell like the 80 year old guy wearing lime green checkered pants.  what part of this don't you people understand?  if you didn't do market research that aspect of it then it makes me wonder about the research done on whether it even works",0
"this doesn't work. first time i tried it, it seemed as if my eye liner smudged more. so i tried it again...and again...and again....i've given up on it. it totally doesn't work",1
both lipsticks were on back order.  i never received either one. please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received,1
"i used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months.  while i thought it moisturized fine, i did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture.  for the money i'd go get several tubes of the neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell much better",1
"i used this product for a couple of months with no visible result. in addition it's quite greasy and since it's not made to be used on the face, we can understand that. but that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses.",0
"but i won't buy this again. it smells good and dipping it into one of the bare escentual powders to make a lipstick is neat. but the product doesn't really moisturize my lips and i haven't found a color i like on my lips once i dip this into a bare escentuals powder. i won't be buying this again, i will probably just try a lip gloss next time",1
"the texture of this product is fine, but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore, therefore overpriced. now, if the flavor and scent were exceptional it might be worth the high price tag, but it doesn't smell that great. it smells rather like over cooked coffee beans.the bare escentuals soy mocha spf 15 has a much nicer smell and texture, if you're wanting a bare escentuals product",1
"my mom had bought their darkest shade and after applying it, it was obvious that she was wearing reddish dark brown eyebrow pencil. it didn't blend in at all, it stood out against her black eyebrow hairs. so i bought her an eyebrow pencil from yves saint laurent in #5. that one is perfect, not too black and not too brown",1
"i am a big philosophy fan.i have bought the best facial cleanser ever from them(purity).i have two other fragrances that i bought scent unsmelled, from them. amazing grace is lovely and pure grace is tremendous. get them. don't buy falling in love. it's yucky",1
"i'm very disappointed with the results. i am fairly young, 31. i have very fine lines and i thought this would make them disappear. it really didn't do anything to my skin. plus it is greasy and has an unpleasant smell. i do not recommend this",0
"i have been using this product for about a month and all it's done is given me puffy eyes. there is no proof that this product works at all and the fda has even written the makers of this product a warning letter to stop making false claims that it helps stretch marks and wrinkles. i've used botox before and believe me, botox works, this product doesn't, so obviously it's not better than botox. i bet the people who gave it 5 stars either work for the company or are fictional entities created by the basic research marketing department so that the product seems better than it actually is",0
"i used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months. while i thought it moisturized fine, i did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture. for the money i'd go get several tubes of the neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell much better.as for ""better than botox""  - buyer beware when you hear this line",1
"one, i don't think this is better than botox.  botox works instantly and more dramatically, but it's more expensive.  however, when you think about how much you're spending on this strivectin, applying it every day for the rest of your life, you could get botox (yes, you need to get more botox every several months, but the costs are about the same).  not only that, but botox simply works better.  however, if you just can't afford botox, then i would buy rulinea fx which is the exact same ingredients as strivectin, but half the price, it's available on hsn.co",1
"i'm pretty sad about this one, especially because of the cost.  i'm 34, with decent skin but some of the typical lines starting around the eyes, forehead, lip line, etc.  my skin does tend toward oily yet sensitive at times, if that context helps any of you out.  a friend of mine all of a sudden looks 10 years younger, beautiful, glowing poreless skin without needing any foundation so i asked her what she was using.  this was one of her key products and she said it took about 2 months for the effect to really be noticeable.  unfortunately i can't use it enough to find out.  first i tried appplying it around my eyes, on my forehead and above my upper lip.  i broke out in really deep cystic acne in those areas after about 4 days.  i started relegating the application only to the eye area and even that is now having a horrible reaction.  i look like i've got insect bites under my eyes, or like i've been punched out.  yuck.  it's gotta be some kind of allergic reaction.  it works so beautifully for my friend, i guess i'll be giving it to her to finish",1
"i used stryvectin religously for two months and one week - more than double the recommended time to get some results - and it has made no more difference to my skin than regular moisturizer. i used it for fine lines on my face and thicker lines on my neck and forehead. to determine if it really worked, i decided to use it experimentally by applying it to the left side of my face only - every day as suggested on the packaging. after all this time, i cannot see the slightest difference between the left side of my face and the right side, and nor can any of my friends. i got better results on my neck when i was using shiseido neck cream which is a third of the price. i would not buy stryvectin again",1
"never had i been so unhappy with my makeup as i was when i was using clinique. i used stay beige (which i lightly patted on my face on top of clinique's superfit liquid makeup - i have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. i also hated how clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that i had to settle for honey in the liquid and beige in the powder. as much as i went back to macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced i was making a big deal out of nothing. instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which i shouldn't have to do in the first place) i just switched to a different makeup line: laura mercier, which i am very happy with.i've had many other friends who were unhappy with clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. i'm not trying to knock the product. i'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people i know. i would definitely not recommend clinique to anyone. i'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.",1
both lipsticks were on back order.  i never received either one. please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received,1
this did not help my skin at all. i would not reccomend it to anyone! save your money!,1
"i have to be honest.  i bought in to all the hype of mineral make-ups.  my sister uses the bare essentials and her skin looked flawless and she has uneven tones like i do.  i didn't want to pay the price or join the club so i tried pur minerals.  i still had to use a ""cover-up"" under my eyes and blemishes and had to put pur minerals on rather heavy to get the ""flawless"" look.  but then it looked too powdery.  i started using my regular cover-girl foundation and powder again as i felt it covered better and less heavy.  just a note, my sister said she still uses a ""cover up stick"" when using bare essentials too, but she looked beautiful in it",1
"this product did nothing for my t-zone. i was still very shiney and oily by mid-day. i recommend benefit's dr. feelgood.i gave this product two stars because though it didn't control oil for me, it didn't feel heavy or clog my pores",1
"this product costs 10 times more then a regular gel.  but it does not even work as well as a regular shaving gel.  its like putting a thin layer of soap on you face.  it did not help at all. no doubt the people who marked this up one thousand present are the geniuses in the marketing department, because, it fooled me just like it fooled everyone; $$$18 for a gel! it must be more effective, ""i'll give it a try"". there is a sucker born every day.jose' (sucker",0

"i love coconuts, and would love it if this made my hair smell like coconuts.  instead, my hair smells like burnt coconuts.  or even burnt newspaper.  the conditioning qualities of the product aren't good enough (and it certainly isn't cheap enough) to make me purchase this again.  at least not until i develop a hankering for smokey-smelling hair",1
"it smells great, like coconut.  i have long curly hair, and it made my hair dry and brittle.  i've noticed this with all of the lush conditioners i've tried, so i would not recommend it for naturally curly hair.  2 stars for the great smell",1
"this is the only lush product thus far that i've absolutely hated. the smell of this is downright revolting and it doesn't do anything for my hair. try retread (my favourite lush conditioner), veganese or even american cream over this one",0
so i bought this item and i hated it. i wash my hair everyday and it completly dryed out my hair! it does smell good though but other than that ive used it about 4 times and thats all it took to realize this is just not for me,0
"there are much better products by lush.i got a free sample of this conditioner and used it along with lush's trichomania solid shampoo.  at first i really liked it, but throughout the day, my hair felt like it was getting oilier.  i'm not sure if it was the trichomania or the coolaulin, but i gave both away to my friend who likes coconut.  the smell wasn't my favorite either (i'm not a coconut person), but if you like coconut, you will love the shampoo and the conditioner.as for me, i will stick to american cream and rehab.**update**december 21, 2005i tried the coolaulin conditioner again, and my hair didn't get oily at all.  i'm not sure what happened the first time i tried it, but it was fine this time around.  i'm not a coconut person, so this conditioner is still not my fave (american cream!!), but i do want to add on two stars and make the rating *~*four stars*~* because the conditioner made my hair really soft",1
"i found this product did absolutely nothing for me...granted i don't have huge wrinkles, but the few i do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! i wish i had asked around from friends, cause if i had i would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. i'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? and is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that really works?

"i quickly realized while in the shower that i don't want to smell like a margarita all day.   it does lather well and i don't find the smell to overpowering but it's not that special.   warning to those of us that chemically treat our hair, this product as a shampoo is very drying and strips color out of hair.",1
"i can't say enough about philosohpy, but i read another review recomending not to get the mimosa scent because it smells like the tang drink, so i purchased the margarita instead.  i hate to say it, but it is probabloy about the same for this product.  it smells so much like kool-aid that i can't use it. the smell is way to sweet.  i am a big margarita fan, but this smells nothing like it!  just a caution",1
"poor quality construction -- the bristles on mine started falling apart on the first use.  plus, it was much rougher than something like loofah.  you might as well tie a couple of shoestrings on a dog brush and use that",0
"any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. i do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). the problem i see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients, but what does it contain instead? if it wears well, doesn't peel, give good color coverage, it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place, logically. please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and add to basket! phthalates, for example, are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. they are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible, and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. they aren't required to be labeled on the products. lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects, especially of the male reproductive system. a nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it), but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. does this contain phthalic anhydride, a toxic chemical hardener? how about fd&c color, such as yellow 5? it's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety. basically put, no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. on top of that, while your at it you should review every lotion, foundation product, etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. i think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed, not partially. companies prey on our worst fears, and what is worse than harming our babies? if this product is so great, let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same, while i'm sounding off on the subject!)",1
"i have to be pretty honest - i was excited to get this kit, but so far i've been disappointed.  maybe i'm not getting the whole technique down, but i find the diagrams pretty generalized and the powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed to (like under my eyes, making them look very raccoon-y and tired--and when wearing smoky eyes, i figure you probably want everything else to look pretty bright in comparison to the dramatic eye effect).  maybe i can't pull of the look or maybe i'm not applying it correctly, but either way, it always ends up looking like a big, dark, glittery mess...i'm a big bare escentuals lover, but i was disappointed with this product.",1
"didn't like this product. all of the actual ""scrub"" (salt) is at the top and minimal.  felt like i would've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub.  it did smell nice and i like the packaging",1
i ordered this march 17th and didnt recieve until april 5th!! it smelled horrible like a weird chalk chemical smell i called lush who said it was probably just a bad batch and to send it back at my own expense ($5) this is after i waited forever to recieve and the product smells horrible..im very mad at lush.com and will not ever order anything from them again except for the angel delight soap..pissedoff,0
i was soooo excited to get this in the mail.  i have very oily skin.  the smell is great but the product is messy and my skin looks like i have acne.  i tried it with fresh farmacy and was so disappointed.  the shipping is insanely high.  i will stick to mac skincare from now on,0
"i enjoyed using this product because i liked the tingling from the mint - not necessarily a good thing, actually rather meaningless to the appearance and cleanliness of my face.  the kaolin and bentonite are drying agents, peppermint is harsh on sensitive skin.  if you separate out the so-called natural ingredients, you are left with the same basic stuff that any other cosmetics company uses.  and if it doesn't come straight out of the ground, it ain't natural anymore!  i give it a 2 because i was a sucker for the tingling, not because i saw any improvement in my skin's texture, look, or feel",1
"well i dint like the smell at all, i see nothing lovely about this perfum, if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season, check out fantasy by britney spears it smells so nice, or curious by britney thats a classic its a must give or have, j.lo's live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present,or for urself its not really worth ur money!",1
"and it's called ""narcisso rodriguez"".   buy the nr, you'll like it a whole lot more",1
"i have oily & blemish prone skin and i was told by my mother, who used to work for the clinique/estee lauder family, to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non-cosmogenic. this product irritated my skin so much that i just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness. the only reason why i used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working. if it was working, it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than i ever had all at once. not worth your money",0
"i don't know why i keep giving clinique a chance.  i have extremely oily skin and this only made it oilier.  if you want a very expensive toner that keeps oil away, try clean & clear for oily skin. it's better and cheaper",1
"i love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  after seeing this set at sephora i tried it for a week and found the results mediocre. my hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but i am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  the shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  the mouse is interesting.  it definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  the overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.  as is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  i believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair.i would recommend you try it.  you can always return it if you're not satisfied",1
overpriced for a mediocre soap with a terrible perfume,0
"i love clinique products in general, but i don't like the soap in the liquid form ... it has a strong chemical smell to it and i find myself holding my breath while washing my face.  i much prefer the bar soap, and wouldn't buy the liquid again, for all that it seemed much more convenient.  no complaints on cleaning-ability",0
both lipsticks were on back order.  i never received either one. please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received,1
"this product might be better on oily skin with no make-up. the point of it was lost on me. it may create a barrier between treatment products/moisturizer and make-up but it did nothing to perfect my skin. in fact when i touched my face i could feel make-up pilling and rolling off. it has a dry, heavy feeling to it. don't use too much and be careful about dry patches. i thought it would make a better canvas of my skin. i now use laura mercier's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow. i didn't like the formulation of philosophy's product at all",1
"i really wanted to like this.  i had heard so much about it and everyone seems to love it.  it smells like sunless tanning lotion on me. i hate that smell.  does it smell like that to anyone else?  oh well, i am disappointed because i really wanted to love it",1
"i wanted it to smell good but it just smells so cheap to me. i tried it several times, but it is not amazing. i would not recommend this perfume",0
"i normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but i wanted to try something different for a change.  i liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  well...i have to disagree.  i think it is very perfumey and not subtle at all. to me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. i thought at first that maybe i had sprayed too much on, so i tried just a little spritz.  still very strong and sharp. and i agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  i will definitely not be ordering this again.",1
"i know this is philosophy's big seller, but i hate the way it smells.  it reminds me of those old ladies that bathe in their fragrance and make everyone around them nauseous.  my husband hated it too, as did my son.i like the comments about it smelling like dead flowers and a dryer sheet.  that is about as close as it gets.if you want a good philosophy scent, go with falling in love, pure grace or philosophy - the scent.  all of them are better than amazing grace.i don't care to smell like a perfumy granny, thank you.  i'll stick with my falling in love",1
"i love chocolatei love dark chocolate, especially for my drinking chocolate.i should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch.marie belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is not cocoa, but cacao...that's why i fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...i guess because of the corn starch...has a strange ""mouth feel"" and flavor that i find unpleasant.i find the french brand  l'ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is charbonnell et walker, which is not for sale (yet) on amazon",1
"i had trouble rinsing this stuff out; it weighed my hair down, and my hair is dry.  also, my son came up to me and said, ""why does your hair smell so funny?"".  i think it's too conditioning for my hair, and too smelly",0
"one of my ""boys"" bought this item for me, and well its ok for the price... its kinda sticky on the skin unless you rub it in really well... and the scent is extremly light which i dont like, now if they were to make it stronger... this would be a 5 star product",1
"i'm going to europe and thought this would save me time in the mornings (and maybe nerves, since i'm traveling with two women and no doubt towels will be in short supply!). but this thing is hard to use, the instructions are poorly drawn, and apparently i have the head of a giant - the button and the button latch (which isn't easy to find and isn't identified in the directions) don't stay together due to my ginormous noggin. the reason i chose this specific product to try was because it was pink and would be clearly different from regular hotel towels and because of the cute tube case - i thought it would pack easily. the material itself seems to work (she says as it slides, yet again, down her forehead to cover her eyes). after twenty minutes of wrestling with this cuddly little critter, i concede. similar items may work, just not this one",1
"i read many positive reviews on pure grace and decided to try it since i love a fresh, clean scent.  i was very disapointed when i used it, as it reminded me of jean nate, which to me is an old lady smell.  it was more musky than clean smelling.  i couldn't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it.  it smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil...that is the only way i can describe it",1
"i am dissatisfied with lush's claims that many of its products, like this one, are natural.  i encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in lush's products.  i have yet to see a lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety.  there are numerous other brands of truly all-natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently",1
"as a huge fan of pink sugar and an avid chocolate fanatic, i was ecstatic to try out chocolovers.  since they don't sell chocolovers anywhere near where i live i decided to order it from sephora.com in the us.  first of all i thought the price was fairly reasonable for 1.7oz bottle (a very nice bottle and package, if i might add), it cost me around $50 cdn.  i was so excited when my order came in today that i quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff.  ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment.  i don't know what i had been expecting, maybe something more like milk chocolate, but what i got was a strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into a very strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk.  this may sound good, but for as much of a fan of sweet candy/foody smells as i am, i found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick.  right now all i can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat seven up.  on the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets.  i think if i were trying to diet i would wear this scent everyday.  i think i will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because i really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in.  i am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness.  the bottom line is try before you buy",1
its cute but it blocks barely any light. lace strap is itchy and uncomfortable.,0
"i've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, i find it temperamental. it does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. if you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. now, it turns off while i'm in the middle of doing my hair. the stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as i said, when they work, they're terrific. i'm going to replace mine with another brand",1
"it could cover the tattoo, but after while, it fails. not fully invisible",0
"if you order this kit, make sure you have time to practice with it!  it takes several practice applications to get the shade just right.  while it does cover completely, it is not flawless. you can tell that you've covered something up on your skin.  if it's not a big deal, you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit",1
"i love philosophy products and own much of the skin care line.  i consider purity facial cleanser a must have.  i was excited to try the hair care line and was so disappointed after using it.  i thought maybe i should give it a good shot and use it a few times to see if it got better with repeated use.  it doesn't.  it is among the worst shampoos i have ever tried.  it's almost worse than the cheapy store bought brands that you use in dire straits.  it instantly left my hair hard and brittle feeling and i couldn't wait to slather the conditioner on.  even after condiditioning, my hair was lifeless and tangled easily!    the poor quality of this product actually made me doubt the entire philsophy line",1
"i bought two clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  the trouble started occurring about two months after using.  one brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!my experience with the customer service has been terrible.  they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!",0
this fragrance is ok for the teen princesses. this scent doesn't linger and is too subtle. not as nice as vera wang vanity or sheer veil. i don't recommend this unless you are 16 and under. i gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it,1
"after having great success with the merkur classic i decided to own up and get the futur.  i was super excited because i thought to myself, ""shoot, one pass instead of two...""  not quite.  for starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  and not the kind of heavy i'm comfortable with trying to shave as i shouldn't feel i might drop the darn thing.  i started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  so day two i went to level 2 on the razor.  same story, second verse.  it left patches and didn't shave well in some areas.  2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there.  went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself.  so for the next week i went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  i give this one star because if it's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn't be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  at least not one this severe.  i get a way better shave using my merkur classic and i really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  i say use caution on the merkur futur.  i also say if you're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  if you're double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind.  only a suggestion.",1
"did not care for this one really, it is better as a body wash",1
"i ordered this for fun and have since decided that it's definitely not for me in any way. it's very drying on my skin, even though it's thick and creamy. the label says it's award-winning, but doesn't state what award it's received (if any!). i fail to see what might warrant it being award-winning. the scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy. also, it's absurdly priced given the quality. i've tried a few philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because i'm always disappointed.",0
"i'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product. i opened this bottle, expecting a totally yummy scent but what i got was nothing like what i expected! when i read that it smelled the nesquick, i thought i'd like it anyway, because i love strawberry nesquick. but this stuff smells like...well, i can't describe it. all i know is i wish i hadn't paid $16 for it. live and learn, i guessperhaps the strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel smells better. off topic, why do they have a strawberry milk shake 3-in-1 gel and a strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel? wouldn't they smell just the same",1
"after reading reviews of the other philosophy items, i was hoping this would smell more like a strawberry milkshake than fake strawberry quick.",1
"i bought this hoping i would look good and get my face cleaned. no lie, this soap makes you look uglier than you really are. so unless you wanna smell a little weird and not look your best, dont buy this soap! im serious!",0

"my experience with this brush has been terrible.  well, the first two or three days were wonderful.  by the third day, the brush was shedding bristles like mad into my razor.  by the second week, the wooden handle (which does look durable) cracked and the plastic sleeve that holds the bristles popped out--never to go back in again.   i am replacing this brush, sadly, after about 15 uses, and i will be purchasing a more expensive brush, i hope with better results.***update, a few months later:  i didn't replace the brush.  i super-glued the bristle-sleeve back into the wooden handle.  it eventually stopped shedding bristles, and i have used it successfully since then.  the wooden handle still looks like it will deteriorate quickly as the finish continues to chip off.  still not recommended, since i don't think i should have to repair a product within the first few weeks of use",1
i knew i was taking a chance buying a cheap eye cream and sure enough i was right. it did nothing! well yo get what you pay for! i was going to try the ocuderm or ddf products and i guess i will do that now. costs more but the results i hear are great. i should of known better...,1

"i purchased this shampoo for my daughter after she read rave reviews in a teen magazine.  she has thick, blonde hair and it was dry from summer heat, pool water, and light styling.  after trying the rehab shampoo, she was so disappointed that it did nothing to help her hair.  she said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  the end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  she was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  we debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and i have to say we are extremely disappointed.  the claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so i fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.  i will say that i bought her a shampoo and condition at the drug store that has helped dramatically.  it is thermasilk smooth & silky line, and it works wonders over rehab for a fraction of the cost.  save your money on this one",0

"i bought this make up at neiman marcus excited to try it and i was horribly disappointed. it was hard to apply (i accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air) and what i did manage to get on my face, it did not cover much.  for the price they wanted this is unexcusable.  i promptly returned my airflash and got my money back.  i do not recommend this product.",0

"i had one stubborn blackhead at the corner of my lip that compelled me to order this. it did work remarkably well on that blackhead, but then i couldn't leave well enough alone. i must have messed up my pores, because now for the first time in my life (i'm 29), i have acne on my chin. the chin is the only place i used this tool (other than that initial blackhead) and now it's one problem after another. not just whiteheads either, cysts that are inflammed and itchy! the only thing that i've done differently with my skin routine is use this, and it's caused me nothing but problems. leave the pore unclogging to a professional; you're opening up quite a can of worms if you take this upon yourself.",0
"one of my former roommates used to have kerastase nutritive shampoo for very dry hair.  i remember it smelling great and being endorsed by celebrities as the ""it"" shampoo for treating dry, unruly tresses. the other day, i saw this shampoo on the clearance shelf at meijers and regrettably made an impulse purchase.  even at clearance price, this shampoo was still expensive. i have very thick, wavy, and somewhat dry hair that needs lots of conditioning products--when i checked out the ingredients (after i bought the shampoo), i groaned inwardly. almost all of the ingredients (with the exception of water) is on the aubrey organics' ""ingredients to be avoided"" list (that is, they are considered toxic).  like aubrey organics, other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens as preservatives because they are mildly estrogenic and can be absorbed through the skin. this shampoo has six different types of parabens--methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.     if a product has such a steep asking price, then you would think that its manufacturers would put forth a better formula, incorporating non-toxic, natural ingredients (like aveda, biolage, and biosilk).  at least suave and v05 (bargain-priced shampoos) can boast about having vitamins and silk amino acids in their formulas (though many of their other ingredients are also found on the ""to be avoided"" list).",1
"i received this free from sephora as a birthday present because i signed up as a beauty insider.  i gave it to my neice for her 7th birthday and she likes it, but there's no reason this product should cost $16.  i'm betting the ingredients, packaging & shipping costs don't total more than $3.  i wouldn't buy it.",1

"i read many good reviews for this product on this site and elsewhere so i eagerly bought it. it came in a quaint little tin but i thought it smelled kind of awful. as a skin softner, it worked well but i threw it out after using it only a few times because of the way it smelled",1
i bought this and shortly after i started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling. i didn't know what was going on and i stopped using it and it immediately went away.. as soon as i started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back.i am a person who doesn't break out very often and i can tolerate many products.i now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it hasn't faded yet. i tried to take it back to nordstrom and they wouldn't exchange it.this product sucks and as it was the only one i was using i know thats what caused the swelling.,0
"my fiance' left this bottle of prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it, it was empty !!!  seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer (pump sprayer) and then it all leaked out and down the bottle ""glueing"" itself to the jewelry box.  now we have an empty bottle of prada and a ruined finish on the top of the jewelry box. i have sent sephora an email explaining what had happened, but have not heard back from them. beware of where you keep this bottle !!!",0
"this is, hands down, the worst perfume i have ever smelled. if you're in the mood to smell sexy, don't wear this. if you're in the mood to smell girlish, don't wear this. if you're in the mood to smell classy, don't wear this. in other words, i have no idea what kind of mood you have to be in to actually want to wear this. i literally went around work asking twenty coworkers what they thought, and they all agreed this was awful. the only person i can imagine wearing this is a senior citizen. it just smells terrible and drab.. and it wasn't that i got a bad bottle either, i've smelled it in stores and it's the same. truly terrible",0
"i bought the ultra hydrating shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment, oh and also the hairspray.  these products dried my hair out horribly and weighed it down.  i gave it 2 weeks because it was so expensive and after two weeks my hair never has looked any worse!  i have naturally wavy, thick coarse hair and this made my hair unmanageable - like a helmet head.  my hair had no movement, no shine--just made it very heavy and weighed down.  last night i used a hair purifier shampoo that gets gunk, minerals, etc out of your hair and after that i deep conditioned it with kerestase masintense - wow, what a difference!!  afer blowdrying my hair it was soft, shiny and had so much bounce!  i woke up this morning and my hair was still awesome.  so glad to have my old hair back - i was beginning to think i had a hormone problem or water problem but it was this ojon product - horrible if you have the type of hair i have.  good luck",1
this stuff is the worst smelling conditioner i ever encountered.  the perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed.  it took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness.  i wish i could give it a negative rating.  i am glad all i used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink,0

"if philosophy makes it for my skin, i think i own it.  i love the microdelivery peel kit which came with 30 of these pads when i bought the set.  the micro-peel is awesome, but these pads were disappointing.  they dried out in their container and they did not keep up the condition of my skin between peels which is how it was marketed in that kit.  i have seen no difference since i discontinued using this product.  seems like it could be much less diluted or could be offered in multiple strengths",1
"my experience: i heard such great things about prevage - restores youthful skin, reverses damage, etc., i couldn't wait until it was available. finally, i was able to buy it - nice packaging, great dispenser of just the right amount. after two months, i found it to be only a great under makeup moisterizer, and there are plenty of others of equal efficacy for 1/10 the price - eucerin, for instance.  kinerase did nothing for me either, so it may just be me - just fyi - fair, sensitive dry skin, middle aged.",1

"i love the cinnamon buns shower gel, so i thought i would try the lip gloss. for one thing, it smells/tastes nothing like cinnamon buns. i don't know what the flavor is, but i don't like it. maybe they have added almond or something. secondly, it's way too sticky. my hair kept getting stuck to my lips. it reminds me of vaseline. since i got this product in a kit, i cannot return it, but i will not be using it again",0
"i bought this item because i heard it was waterproof and i was looking for something to wear swimming. i'm really not impressed. the one thing i will say for it is that the color blended well with my skin. in the bottle it looked like it would be way too dark, so i was surprised by that. it looks like there might be a little wiggle room as far as choosing the correct shade with this one. the coverage is not very good, though. you can put a little extra on without it looking cakey, but it doesn't cover as well as say lancome's photogenic foundation. i also highly doubt that it is waterproof. water-resistant, maybe. defintely not waterproof. it rubbed off pretty easily with a dry kleenex and even more came off with a wet one. when i tried coverblend's water resistant makeup i had to use soap to get it off. the coverage was also much better. unfortunately they don't offer many shades in the leg & body makeup. i also found that the dew finish did not work for my skin. i have combination skin and tend to have a shiny t-zone. this foundation left me with a shiny nose and forehead. it also made the rest of my face feel slightly oily, which it normally does not. overall i would say this foundation is a very poor value and i will defintely be returning it to sephora. at least sephora has free returns. :",1
"this did nothing for my lashes, which are blonde, but long, so it doesn't take all that much.  it somehow made them look skimpy and clumpy too.  i discovered diorshow after this and it's phenominal!   but if you want a very good mascara and don't want to spend the money, i recommend max factor 2000 calorie.",1
i tried this mascara expecting great things but was very disappointed.  the mascara seemed dry and it took too long to apply enough so that it even looked like i had lashes (my natural lashes are almost clear).  back to the drawing board of looking for the holy grail of mascara,1
"i bought this mascara based on a review i read on amazon. maybe it's just me, but i still find that my lashes ""clump"" or stick together with this product. it might be the navy color. i don't think its worth the extra cost - i do just as well with drugstore mascara",1
"i have been on a search for the perfect mascara for many years now, just as many of the reviewers had been.  i purchased this mascara based on the reviews and i am more than disappointed in the mascara.  i would not give you 2 cents for the product and would love to return it.  the mascara is clumpy and will not stick to the eyelash.  i do not mind paying $25.00 for a tube of mascara if it doe's the job, this one doe's not.  i had better luck with max factor, clinque, etc.",1
"for me, it barely looked like i had mascara on at all.  i have blonde eyelashes, so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop, and this didn't really.  i ended up giving it to my mom, thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it, and she didn't like it either.  it ended up in the garbage.  i've loved dior show mascara and of course, great lash.  i'd recommend those over this, especially for the money",1
"the smell is gorgeous; it really lives up to its name ""happy"" -- (being just lightly musk-touched with citrus overtones - it's a great scent for day or night), but -- and this is a big but, like real happiness, it is very elusive.  as a scent on the skin, it completely fades away after 10 minutes!  for example, today i sprayed it quite liberally and now can't smell it at all, even if i put my nose to my wrist; i swear, it is completely gone.  very disappointed, and thus cannot recommend it.  5 stars for the scent but minus 4 stars for the staying power = 1 star.even the lightest perfumes should have staying power, or else what's the point of wearing them?",1
this perfume is very mediocre. one of my friends loved it and on the spur of the moment i decided to give it a try. what a waste! its not unpleasant but so unremarkable that 10 seconds after spraying you forget what it smells like. wouldn't be buying it again,1
this product does absolutely nothing.  it made my face look even more queasy and dry at the same time.  save your money,1
"the eyeshadow isn't bad, nice color, but the packaging was a disappointment. the brush sits down the center of the encased loose powder and you can't get very much onto the brush. there is no way to open the casing either, so its pretty useless. i found the powder to be an odd texture for a loose eyeshadow also.",0
"i got talked into buying this at the fresh boutique in las vegas.  first, it's very expensive - $38, forgivable if it were outstanding.  it's not even good.  the wand isn't well made, and the product does clump on it, and then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them.  i have tried all week to make this purchase work out for the best, but to no avail.  the worst part is, at the end of the day if i happen to rub my eyes, it smears - racoon eyes.  i've been using physicians formula and revlon with the primer both are exponentially better, and i could have purchased eight of them for the cost of supernova.  on the positive side, it washes off easily and completely with soap and water.",1
very clumpy! - i would never purchase this again... it looked like i had one big eyelash - they were all clumped together -worse one i have ever used,0

"my sister-in-law bought this product for me after i had admired the shade (purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. i have used other mac products before with great results, but was very dissapointed with this product. first of all, i gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. however, this product is sticky. very sticky! it does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. when i wear a lip gloss, i want to be soft and smooth feeling. i want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. this will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  this product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, i would never reccomend this to anyone",1
"i had never tried anything from philosophy and wanted to try the 3 in 1 stuff, and i thought the lavendar pound cake would smell really good. i was actually really disappointed. it sucks as a shampoo, and body wash too- i ordered the blueberry pie too, and i haven't even used it, its just sitting in my closet. for the price you get a lot and lasts long, but i wasn't impressed",0
"i usually love the philosophy brand bath and shower gels, but this was a major disappointment-didn't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter-in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating. there are other gels that are great but avoid this one! phew!!",1

"the company/shipping was fine.  no beefs there.  the product itself i find to be rather damaging to the skin.  in order to extract, you have to press down extremly hard, (if you can even locate what your attempting to extract w/that darn pin hole at the end.)  i can't imagine this wouldn't leave scars.  i wouldn't reccomend this product. i just put it in the drawer, never to be used again.  :",0
"so, i've owned a tweezerman extractor before, and i am now questioning why i didnt go with my instinct and just stick with the familiar...this extractor is no help what so ever. the loop hole is entirely too small and it would be by complete and utter chance that i would press the right pore. its just too small to even target. the lance is helpful for blackheads but it is really sharp and if youre not careful, you could damage your skin. i would recommend not buying this extractor. i would much rather have preferred to sticking with the tweezerman..",0
"the only reason i'm giving this two stars instead of one is because i love benefit. that being said, this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper. it's so faint that you can hardly smell it, but when you do, it's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better. if you are looking for a young, fun perfume, stay away from this one. it smells old and drab, like your grandmother's china cabinet or an antique store. but if you like that..",1
"maybe i expect too much.  however, even my lowest expectation wasnt met.  just go ask a dermatologist to help, dont waste your money",1
"i found strivectin-sd eye cream to be a nicely textured cream, but it was too heavy for my skin. this is rather strange, as i have dryish skin around my eyes and like a heavier eye cream. this one clogged up my orbital area so much that i got millia (which i never suffered from before). the cream does not absorb very well, but feels good to touch. in terms of wrinkles, i had 0 effect. i in my late 20's and am strating to notice the first crow's feet. strivectin-sd did nothing to alleviate them. i have to express an opinion on the price though. if you do like the product and it works for you, price should not be an issue, as the tube lasts forever. i have used it for 6 months easily and am now getting concerned that eye products should be thrown away after such long time. yet it hasn't run out yet. i give it 2 out ot 5 - for the nice texture. and an impressive  advertising campaign that convinced me to try it!",1
i purchased this item with the recommendation of a make-up sales representative at nordstrom's.  i was less than pleased with the product.  i used the entire container and saw no benefit!!,1
"i wouldn't call these a regrettable purchase...i guess i was just a little mislead about how these thing worked.  it doesn't explain that on the packaging. i couldn't figure out why the box was so heavy.  they are just socks, right?  right??  well, they aren't.  the insides are coated with some sort of heavy-duty silicone.  this makes your feet sweat when you put them on.  i mean, they really sweat.  when you wake up, you're feet have sweat so much that any outer layer of skin cells you have sloughed off.  hence the soft feet.  and very warm feet.  they'll be good for winter.the reason why you're only supposed to wear these once a week is because i bet you'll get a really alarming fungus if you do it more.  i tried them two nights in a row once and day 3 greeted me with an intense athletes-foot-like itch.  not fun.  the other gripe i have is that they don't come with washing instructions.  great.  these socks have one purpose in life, and that is to make your feet sweat and then refuse to be washed.  i found that handwashing them in the sink with some handsoap works fine.  for now, anyway.  i don't think they belong in the washing machine.  a laundry horror story is likely to ensue.",1
"never had i been so unhappy with my makeup as i was when i was using clinique. i used stay beige (which i lightly patted on my face on top of clinique's superfit liquid makeup - i have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. i also hated how clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that i had to settle for honey in the liquid and beige in the powder. as much as i went back to macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced i was making a big deal out of nothing. instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which i shouldn't have to do in the first place) i just switched to a different makeup line: laura mercier, which i am very happy with.i've had many other friends who were unhappy with clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. i'm not trying to knock the product. i'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people i know. i would definitely not recommend clinique to anyone. i'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.",1
why is this product advertised here for $100 more than the cost of purchasing it directly from the la mer website,1
listen up!!! ... l'occitane shea 24 hour ultra rich face cream 1.7 ounce- has the same moisturizing results- for a fraction of the cost!!!- :),1
"over $1,000 for moisturizing cream?  as the saying goes: ""a fool and their money are soon parted",0
a complete waste of money.  i still have all my stretch mark,0
i didn't care for it.  it smelled good but that's the only good thing i can say.  it neither helped or harmed my hair.  i don't think i would buy it again,1
yikes.  i was so surprised at the size of the bottle.  i had no idea it would be that small for the price. the scent is nice but i would not reorder.,1
i bought this with a kit. this stuff was just not worth it to me. but unlike the others i cannot stand the smell. it is very strong and gave me a headache so i could not really leave it on that long. my scalp did feel conditioned though. but if you are sensitive to strong smells be aware that this stuff may bother you.,1
what's the point of this mascara when half the container doesn't do what it's supposed to do? the black mascara is not good quality--it comes off very quickly. part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny--larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara. and the silver stuff--the only reason someone would seek out this product--is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand.,0

"clinique's exfoliating scrub is a facial scrub for oily skin. it is a thick, white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in clinique's ""7 day scrub"" for normal skin. to use, massage onto clean, wet skin in a circular motion. rinse with warm water. careful not to get it in your eyes, as i did once while rinsing it off in the shower. this scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. but it's unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven. it contains menthol, which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. of course, it is ""100% fragrance free"" according to clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. the scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently. the performance isn't bad. the olfactory aesthetics are atrocious. this is the harshest, most caustic facial scrub i've ever used. sensitive complexions beware",1
"i love clinique products and have used them for more than 20 years. the exfoliating scrub is convenient because it comes in a tube and rinses off easily. (though you only get 3.4 oz., and must use quite a bit of it to see good results). however, it does not work as well as the original ""seven day scrub"". the original product while greasy and a bit of a pain to use, exfoliates almost as well as professional microdermabrasion and does not irritate - even with daily use. a few years ago i spent the summer neglecting to use my sun block. needless to say, my skin became a mess (dull, blotchy, discolorations, rough, flaky, etc.). i began my basic clinique regimen (mild facial soap, clarifying lotion #2, dramatically different moisturizing lotion, and the seven day srub). in less than two weeks i saw a huge difference, my skin was back to normal. i had tried the exfoliating scrub later, since i hated to deal with the original ""seven day"" but soon went back to it as it truly works best. now i always wear an spf 45 on my face and stick with my seven day scrub.",1
"it is true that this product smells absolutely awful after it is applied to the face. worse, it does absolutely nothing. i have been applying a significant amount morning and night, for 6 weeks, allowing it to soak in and dry... it does nothing",0
"i have been using the product faithfully for several weeks, usually twice daily and have not seen any difference in facial brightening.  i would not repurchase this product",1
"i've had excellent luck with tweezerman products in the past, but the quality of this blackhead remover was second-rate.  the item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw-in attachments.neither attachments really work.  the threading of both seems to be flawed.  and to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face; no thanks!my e-mailed request for re-threading or replacement to tweezerman went unanswered.  this purchase was an expensive mistake",0
"wanting to try  something new, i picked up this little spritz. i was looking for an engergizing 'pick-me-up' that i could use in the middle of the day. i won't purchase this item again. after regular use, i did not find any difference in my skin (normal-oily, make-up free), did not experience any engergizing feeling, and quickly discovered that this product tastes terrible. the directions state to 'close your eyes and spray 10cm from you face' but this method lands the product on your lips - that would be how i discovered the awful taste.the one redeeming value i have for this product is the scent; i'm a huge fan of citrus based scents. but that benefit does not justify the cost of this product.",1
"i received the vanilla grapefruit sticks as a gift from one of my boys.  the sticks are very thin and only burn about halfway down the entire length.  re-lighting is useless bc there is no fragrance left at the bottom half of the stick to burn.  the scent doesn't remind me of vanilla grapefruit- more like plain burning sticks, which won't cost you $13.  votivo does candles well, but the aromatic sticks leave something to be desired.  not worth the money.",1
"i ordered this product because it was recommended to me on another skincare website.  however, i haven't wanted to use this product much due to it's odor.  very medicinal/chemical smelling.  makes me wonder what sort of harsh chemicals are going on my face!  i used it pretty consistently the first two weeks and didn't notice any difference in my skin.  i wouldn't recommend this product, unless a dermatologist specifically tells you to use it.",0
"this item was fine when it came to pictures; tattoos were not visible on film for the first part of our wedding. however i was told by a few of the guests that it looked like i had been in a fight before the wedding... make-up should not look like bruises!the make-up also started to fade not long after the ceremony ended, and it was a short ceremony.  by the end of the reception (four hours later) you could clearly see the tattoos.also, i was told that the make-up would not rub off onto clothing if i used the special setting powder together with the cream... not true.  i now have make-up stains on one of my brides maids dresses.i realize now that i should have just let the tattoos show.  why have a tattoo if you're not willing to show it off",1
i received my order and was very dissapointed.  the skin tones online are deceiving.  i ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy.  doesn't blend well with skin.  suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone,0
"dermablend leg and body cover reminds me alot of mud.  you know how you get mud on your shoes and it is dark at first but then dries to look alot lighter and flakes off?  that's a very accurate comparison to this product.  it sets to a very chalky, dry, finish which appears flaky and has a pasty, corpse like gray tinge to it.  it is creepy looking!  even with all of the colors that are available it still looks unnatural and ashy when dry. the only way i was able to use it was to cover my tattoo with the product and then disguise the hideously fake makeup under a pair of thick, shimmery dance tights!! you couldn't pull it off with just the makeup on your bare skin though.it would be great if you want to dress up like a mummy or decaying corpse for halloween though",0
i love philosophy products but this shower gel smelled nothing like strawberries more like fluoride treatment for kids. i was really bummed out. try the cinnamon buns it is so much better.,1
"okay so in the beginning, i was so excited about this perfume.  it smelled amazing and the scent lasted forever.  when i say forever, literally forever.  you spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep?  it lasts until the next afternoon.  it's not even just a weak scent that's left on you.  it's like as if you've been spraying it constantly. but here's the bad part.  after using it for awhile, i felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong.  i felt like the scent was a little too deep.  it's great for people who like strong distinct scents.  if not though, this isn't the product for you",1
"this was my first cologne purchase.  it's a really delicious scent -- complex and pleasant, not overpowering.  give it 15 min to dry and mix with your skin.  it truly does smell different from the first spray.  i can't stop smelling myself...i really love the smell.my only complaint (and it's a biggy) is that it doesn't last for more than a few hours.  after two or three hours it's completely gone except for a slight trace when i press my nose to my skin.  i've tried spraying it on my body (neck, wrists) and also my clothing, and it just doesn't last.  i feel the need to carry the bottle with me and reapply it every few hours, but that's not going to realistically happen.  it's really disappointing, since it's so delicious",1
"there is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  however, i didn't see any changes in my daughter's hair after using this conditioner.  none.  it is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly. otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  i was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  however, i found this conditioner to be all hype",1
"i bought the entire line of products from the lisa's hair regimen on the carol's daughter website. i took all the products back to sephora yesterday. i used this hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. i washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. i wear my hair natural and i had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. when i took the product back to sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was red w/ white spots all throughout it. i had to take otc pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. the only thing i can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. the product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. if you have allergies to these items i would suggest not using this product. i contacted carol's daughter and have not heard back from them yet. i would have expected more from the company who's product states 'made with love, peace'.",0
i just received my conditioner today and it's going back to sephora. i don't know how this can be called a conditioner because it's nothing more than water. it also smells nothing like vanilla. the only scent i could smell was coconut and i don't want my hair smelling like that,0
"ok, so this is the 2nd philosophy product that i've tried and felt the need to write a review on. i have to say, this product is far below expectations. i sprayed in on, and the only thing you smell is the alcohol. there seems to be no other notes to it, even after you let it settle, all you can pick up is alcohol. definitely not recommending this product.",1
i bought this for travel/gym bag use. when it arrived i opened all bottles and sniffed. the frangrace was very masculine smelling. i guess this is the yerba mate aroma which is very earthy smelling,1

"this stuff is supposed to help razor burn, ingrown hairs. honestly after all the time using it i can't honestly say if it works. what i can say is that it smells terrible. not a weak terrible smell, but a strong, overpowering stink.it also burns like crazy when you put it on.the tend skin company puts out this story about a miraculous discovery - a dentists patient came to him after a tooth extraction and raved that whatever the anesthetic was that he was given, it had cured his ingrown hairs.well, there are three ingredients in tend skin - alcohol, glycerin, and aspirin. thats it.so apparently this dental patient had been cured of ingrown hairs by taking an aspirin.bottom line is, this product is insanely overpriced, and they hide it with this distortion, this silly propaganda about its ""miraculous discovery.""a little bottle of alcohol and aspirin should cost a tenth of this",1
"i bought this stuff because i heard it helped with razor burn. my husband likes me to shave a bit more often than i liked, well, too bad for him!! the pain from putting this stuff on was way worse than any sort of razor burn! no thanks!",0
"i have always had problems with razor burn and shaving issues overall.  it used to be a disaster and i was introduced and used tend skin for the past two or three years now.  i got a sample of solution 2 out in the hamptons last weekend and i could not possibly be happier.  it is a significant improvement over tend skin--the roller ball applicator is brilliant and i have officially (thankfully) pitched my cotton ball bag.  it does not sting nearly as much as tend skin.  it smells so much better (actually pretty good!) and it works better too.  i used to get very dry patches on my neck from using tend skin but i have had no dryness issues with solution 2.  i used to have a strict regimen using tend skin in order to get through my shaving procedure.  now, i roll on the solution 2 and it's all good:)",1
i really do not feel tend skin works as advertised. the irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed. one good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning --- tend skin helps for that! just take a strong whiff and you'll be alert and ready for your day!,1
"i used to use tend skin. it works ok, but there are better things out there now. tend skin is an outdated product...like the sytptic pencil. tend skin stings, smells like pure alcohol and there is lots of wasted product because it is easy to spill. i recently switched to min solution2 like it much better than tend skin. min solution2 has a roller application (no waste), organic spearmint (fresh smell) and doesn't burn like tend skin.",1
"i received my order of three oils...jasmine,ambergris, and musk...their fragrance was so obscured by the oil medium that you cut the essential oil with that they all smelled very close to the same...i have caswellmassey oils from 30 years ago and they are still true to their fragrance and it is true...one drop will last all day and often linger for more...have they sold out or sold their name i only ordered three oils because somewhere i read if you order 25 dollars or more from you the shipping was free...this was not the case...i was charged for shipping these products i received are a joke...the caswellmassey name is no longer associated with an exemplary product...i am sure the original caswellmassey folks are turning over in their graves every time you send this ""jokeoil"" to an unsuspecting customer...shame on you...shame on you all",0
"this mascara works great; it lengthens, separates, and defines your lashes and it doesn't smudge, but it's so hard to take off!  i used lancome's bi-facil makeup remover, which is designed to remove waterproof mascara, but it was still hard to remove.  i lost quite a few lashes in the process.  i would recommend buying the regular definicils, not the waterproof",0
"i love these products however, this particular candle does not have the same, intense scent as previous candles i've purchase",1
"after reading the great reviews of the votivo candles i decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.when i received the candle i smelled sweet spice coming from it even before i opened the packaging.readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice i hopefully lit the candle.after about an hour of the candle being lit i came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way i didn't get jacked on this purchase i lit it again-this time for 3 hours.there was still no smell.compare this with the $6 'tea' candles i bought from the gold canyon candle co. which when i lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!if your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store. jipped-you bet",1
"i should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like ""lemon pledge""...it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all.  i'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room",0
"this perfume smells like you just sprayed lemon pledge all over.  it was terribly strong and just not quite what i wanted.  the company did promptly give me a refund though.  i suggest you try out ""demeter fragrances.""  they are more natural smelling",1
this product is no better than any regular washcloth and/or headband to hold your hair back. save your money,1
"i have tried the lush products and found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me to the melt product line. any benefits i thought i was getting from lush... out the window. their products seemed, all the sudden, unimpressive. and i really like that melt is denver based! try them out and see what you think for yourself (if you aren't here in colorado i know they have online products too) and make your own choice. i recomend them though and i have told everyone i know to switch! :-",1
"like the fresh farmacy, i bought this soap based on the reviews and ended up giving it to a friend at work.  don't get me wrong, i love most of lush's products and, to my husbands chagrin, end up spending a lot of money on their online products but when i got this particular soap i just couldn't get into it.  i admit that it smelled a bit better after showering with it for the first time but still found myself reaching for my ""sexy peel"" over this stuff.  i ended up giving it to a friend that i work with but only after it had been passed over my three other girls in my office...i'm just not getting the ""heavenly scent"" that this item was described as having in previous reviews",1
"this product didn't work for me, as described. first of all, it does smell nice, which is different from the usual fumes nail polishes give off! smells lemony! its also easy to use - you brush it on over nails and surrounding area, let it set for awhile until it gets dull and then gently buff it off with a tissue. that was all fine and dandy, but it didn't leave my nails all that dry, nor did it leave them shiny. in fact, they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats i use. i also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated, but i've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when i woke up and i let them dry for a few hours after painting them! i wouldn't recommend this product.",0
"when i got this candle i was very excited, but when i lit it, it seemed to make a scent that strongly smelled of fart. when i put it out, the fart smell went away",1
"i bought this for my wife for the holidays, it was a bit expensive for a candle but i believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly. however, in our case, after about an hour the candle went out. the wick burned too quickly, becoming too small, and now the candle won't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax. the return shipping will cost a lot, so we will just toss it out. waste of money, don't buy one",0
"try: bill's sliver gripper tweezersi have not purchased any other tweezers since finding ""bill's sliver gripper tweezers"" they are simply the best, easiest and most painlessly precise tweezers i have ever owned.... and amazon has them... $",1
"i got very irresistible by givenchy perfume as a gift for christmas.  as first smell, i loved it.  then i spritzed it and yikes! that was 2 months ago and i still have the scent on me.it's too flowery -- it's not a clean, fresh scent.  more of a ""i sprayed a little too much potpouri in here"" scent.  not for people with mild allergies to perfumes either!!",1
"if you're really looking forward to brightening your blonde, go to the salon and ask for a non-ammonia hair lightening or use an otc temporary product.  chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color.  the expense of this product is not justified by the results, and while lush likes to toot its horn about being ""natural"", that designation could apply to arsenic.  it's pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives - the parabens",1
"i'm black and for my hair type, 4b, i try to use natural products on my hair and it didn't have those ""no-no chemicals and oils"" that are known to be damaging to black hair.  well this product did not, as it advertised, which was to ""stay put.""  i tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb-coils or finger-coil in place.  i did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good.  sad thing is that i can't get my money back. i use it as a hair grease for my scalp. i hope i've been helpful",1
"this brush was not as firm as expected.  i expected greater quality from the sephora brand.  however, the price of the brush was rather cheap in comparison to ""finer"" brushes.  so in actuality you are getting whay you pay for with this item and nothing more",1
"it stings, burns and irritated my skin. didnt prevent any breakouts. i bought the whole complex set and this is the one that hurts the most. 0 stars if i could. need i say more",0
"i ordered the saturday morning special gift set and tried the tui herbal shampoo right away.  as with everyone else, no lather and lots of tangles.  after the second wash, i decided to use my pantene relaxed and natural to try and get some lather and moisture in my hair.  this stuff is a rip off.  on the plus side, it works fabulously on my children's hair. they are bi-racial and have naturally curly hair.  i don't recommend this to anyone with relaxed hair.  it just doesn't work",1
"this shampoo is just awful. it's greasy and it's made up of a 90/10 ratio, 90 being oil and 10 being soap. smells great but leaves your hairl slimy and gross",0
"maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products.  however, this shampoo did not work for me.  like the previous reviewer said, it was watery and did not lather at all.  it also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard.  i followed up with a hair smoothie, but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair.  i do not recommend this at all",0
"this shampoo is so bad that i thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake. it is watery and does not lather. my hair felt like it hadn't been washed for days, and the next day i had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film. i never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting $10.00",0
all i can say is do not buy this [...].  i just got this stuff and used it for the first and last time.  it smells horrible.  it left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad i could not even get a comb through it.  i had to wash my hair (with a different product of course) at least 6 times to get it back to normal again...........what a complete rip off!!!,0
"i received two sizeable chunks of karma soap in a couple of my orders and i thought i'd give it a go.  eeeep - there's a whole bunch of patchouli in there (which i hate, but still thought i should at least try).  maybe i'm overly sensitive to the patchouli but it was so strong.  the soap as a whole smelled like a sickening mix of syrup-y orange soda mixed with that dreaded patchouli.  to be fair though, you can smell different elements in it and appreciate it for that.  aside from this, this soap melts incredibly fast.  even if you keep it in a draining soap dish, even if you take it completely out of the shower, away from the steam,  it still melts at an alarming rate!i can see how people (who love herbal scents) would like this.  it is a unique scent that has depth and layers to it,  but it's just not for me",1
"i have glorious white hair, and i thought this would be good for it.  but it seems to dry my hair too much, and frankly i don't see that it's any better than the two dollar bottle of suave that's out there. i've also used lush's big shampoo and soak 'n' float shampoo bars, and i like them much better.",1
"i have to agree with another reviewer. this product is not worth the price tag. it claims to have a vanilla scent, and it does, but it is barely noticible. don't buy this product based on how it smells. as a moisturizer, you can do much better for $23.00.",1
the shipping was very slow and the product really isn't worth $23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar.  the product goes on like lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin.  then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin.  overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what i expected or wanted.  i was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer.,1
"like said in an earlier review, after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you can't see a thing in it in the shower.  i run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes, then you can't clear it with any method.  total waste, not worth a dollar.",0
"i love laura mercier's skin products, but her makeup line has these dark, cherry-burnt-orange-rasberry colors that just don't work for fair skin or  blonde hair (which i have.) i wish her colors were better, there was only 1 eye color i could wear in this kit, and the 3 glow stick things were confusing, because they weren't sticks.",1
"i read about bobbi brown tinited moisturizer as a recommendation in a magazine and decided to try it.  i went to saks and the saleswoman ""made up my face"" using the moisturizer.  i thought i liked the look in the store and felt the coverage stayed on all day during my shopping.  however, the next day when i applied the moisturizer alone without all the other products i discovered i didn't like it.  it went on and immediately the product seemed to sink into the pores of my skin and also seemed cakey.  i am going to return this product and the concealer that i bought as well.  this product just doesn't apply very smoothly.  i think i will try the laura mercier tinted moisturizer that everyone is raving about instead",1
"as rosey as this oils smells, it just isn't as good as the real thing.  being a fragrance oil, it has no medicinal properties.  i certainly wouldn't use it on my skin, or in a bath!  thanks, but no thanks.  you definitely get what you pay for",1
this product was such a waste. the little granules made a mess when used as a styling agent for blow-drying the hair. i will not repurchase it.,0
i first bought inis cologne in ireland in 2001 and have not used anything else since that time.  i will go to great lengths to find the cologne.  i am very glad it is now being offered by amazon,1
"when i first spray inis energy of the sea cologne spray, i could not smell any thing! then i spray more and more 'till i found out how it smells! it has nice scent, okay, i'll tell you how i found it; it is not bad! but despite that, it doesn't last for more than half an hour, and then it hardly can be smelled. you may need to have it with you all the time and spray every half hour. this is what disappointed me the most!i am telling you my taste here, that isn't necessarily yours.",0
"i was very excited to receive this product,yet my enthusiasm quickly turned to confusion.call me foolish,but i thought perfume was to have a sweet,pleasant aroma{?. this pot had the distinct scent of a citronella {skeeter} candle...like the one i could smell burning from my neighbors yard last summer!!!! i kept applying and re-applying it to ""get a smell"" from it...not much luck. maybe the spray perfume smells far better??? i do not understand how the founder says this perfume gets so many compliments!how? if i rubbed the bug candle wax on my wrists, i would not have gals clammoring around me asking me what i was wearing!!!!i wore this a few times just to see the reactions.....only 1 person said they could ""sota"" smell something! i tried paris hilton, and britney's fantasy, and got tons of compliments! buy at your own discretion",1
i opened my falling in love compact expecting a lovely smell after reading the hype.this is the worst smelling perfume-ever.when i put it on it smelled like burnt clothing-like an iron had just done it's worst on cotton.it was so awful i put it straight in the bin,0
"falling in love is one of my favorite scents ever.  it's basically my go-to fragrance for everyday.  if you're a fan of this scent you already know it's really pretty but very light.  that's why i was exited about the solid for touch-ups on the go.  let me tell you, subtle is an understatement for this product. when i opened the seal and held it under my nose i could hardly smell it.  when i applied it (generously) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable.  i rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn't help at all.  i expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice.  very disappointing.",1
"the description represents a .2 ounce solid fragrance.  as a lover of all things philosophy, i was very disappointed to get something half the size i expected...which was .13 ounces!  my 2 stars are only because the fragrance is divine...as are they all!",1
"i received this soap free with an online purchase. i have never purchased soap from lush and i don't think i will after my experience with ooh la la. the scent is pleasant enough, and the color of the bar is this stunning deep purple (kind of like a grape!), but it doesn't feel like soap when i'm using it. it kind of smears a purplish film on me and then when i rinse it off, my skin feels very tight and dry. i've been unable to get any lather from this bar, although admittedly i do have very hard water where i live. i read that previous reviewers complained about how long this soap lasts. like with all lush products, it's imperative that you not leave it in the shower or tub and let it dry completely between uses. i've used the bar four or five times and while it's noticeably smaller than when i opened it, i probably have about 90 percent of it left.",1
"i was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when i got this soap,  but sadly, that's not what happened.  the smell is a very strong herbal;  like the kind you would add to an italian pasta dish.   not very appealing!  there is some complexity to the scent, but it's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through.  on the plus side,  the color is beautiful (a rich, dark purple) and the lather is equally lovely to look at.  if you like true herbal scents, then you should give this a try.  it just wasn't for me.",1
"love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product! well, this one used to have about 3 five-star ratings. i added my two cents- this product did nothing for me whatsoever. so, some people love it. i don't get it. and, it's pretty much the opposite of an anti-oxidant, so that doesn't make sense. i pointed this out in my review. wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough?also, it's listed at $45 on amazon as well. from the same supplier. huh",1
i bought this from sephora.  it left my hair a greasy mess.  and i have dry coarse hair.  it was very greasy and didn't rinse out well at all,0
"i can truly say that this products doesn't work. i have silky wavy fine hair and i am a hair food junkie so i used a lot of things, but this don't work. usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard, matted, and tangled. carol daughter's products may work for some, but it hasn't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures",1
"""happy""  has a really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins. it is like cheap colognes.",1
"i ordered the gift set and it came as advertised. very cute package. unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast (that i could find) so i could not test it. it is far too strong a scent, even the lotion. the candle filled the house with the scent in 10 minutes. my advice, find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing",1
i should have known better. people were telling me to use dermaaction from www.topicalbeauty.com but i wasted my money on hylexin instead. saw no results. dermaaction on the other hand is making a huge change in my skin and my eyes look way better now. next time i'll listen,1
"i really wanted this to work.  i have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else.  but i've been using this twice a day for two months and i haven't noticed any improvement at all.  not even a little.  in fact, my eyes might actually look worse.  it has not faded the dark circles, nor has it improved the bags.",0
"i fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money....... save your money, trust me! i used this product 2-3 times a day until the entire tube was gone (took several months) and saw no change whatsoever! i have serious dark circles, which is what it claims to help. i am very disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again! what a bunch of crap......   btw - look at *all* the reviews, this product is listed in several places here !!",1
"after i ordered this product, one of my co-workers told me about the reviews on amazon.  i checked it out and i was really surprised!  the reviews are poor.  the worst part, though, is that the product is listed three times!!  what's the deal??  a product gets a bad review, so they re-list it... more bad reviews and they re-list it again!  see for yourself, do a general search for ""hylexin"" and you will see several listings of the same product.  trying to out run bad reviews????  i now think less of the product and amazon.  shame on you both",0
this stuff is very expensive and i've diligently used it as the directions state. i havent seen growth. i am actually losing more eyelashes!! i was going to buy the mascara if i grew the eyelashes but it doesn't seem to be working. *sigh,0
"the click-stick applicator is ridiculous. you have no control over the shadow. when you click it, nothing comes out. you have to twist about ten times, and then, suddenly, a huge blob, enough for eighteen applications, comes busting out. the only way i've found to apply this is to use my own shadow brush dipped in this huge blob. i purchased three colors at the same time and all three tubes work in this same way. as far as the actual shadow, it's fine. nothing spectacular. you could get the same product from wet'n wild for a buck.",1

"i have an ancient lancome facial brush that i was attempting to replace.  i bought this brush, tried it, and went back to my old one.  in my opinion, this brush is far too soft and doesn't feel like it is cleaning at all.  a wash cloth would be better",1
i spent the $$$ for this supposed miracle product a month ago....don't waste your money...absolutly no results.,1
"i have horrible bags and deep creases along edge of preorbital area. of all the products i have tried, olay regenerist eye cream works the best. also my plastic surgeon said that part of the dark purple is my muscle showing thru because i have excess skin but no fat in periorbital area. he said he will inject fat from my rear(plenty) and that will lessen the color, and after he removes excess skin, he will use laser",0
"i paid $100.00 for a tube of hylexin because i have serious dark circles.  unfortunately, i fell for the hype because i would have tried anything that says, ""significantly reduces dark circles!""  i followed the directions and waited....nothing!  i teach business ehtics at a university.  part of the course involves ethics in advertising.  i use the hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording, the packaging, etc.please take my word for it and save yourself some money",0

"i have eczema, so my scalp is very dry and sensitive. this relaxer burned my hair so severely i though it would fall out. i developed huge scores with thick scabs after having this relaxer professionally applied to my hair.",1
"i used phytospecific relaxer on my virgin hair during the summer (2006). i first thought it to be a great investment ($60) and worth the cost. after use, i found my hair to be relaxed but not ""bone straight"" as i've experienced with other relaxers which is what i desired. my hair is very soft and fine and quite sensitive to chemicals so i was in search of a product that would straighten my hair and not leave any damaging affects.after the 2nd treatment (september 2006), i soon found that my hair was experiencing breakage around the temples and severe breakage at the nape of my neck. i quit using the product.perhaps this product works for some but as mentioned earlier, my hair is quite sensitive to chemicals and unfortunately, i experienced hair loss! so, it's back to the drawing (or growing) board for me",1
"i am black american and have combination hair...nappy, wavy and straight.  i've been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (creme of nature, tcb, dark & lovely, revlon realistic) whatever is ""on sale"" with satisfying results.   these products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process.  i usually wash my hair after a few days (i like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle.  from there i am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  in general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners.  my biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair.  i'll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair.  i have great success with frederic fekkai products and love phytodefrisant botanical hair relaxing balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too.  (bumble and bumble styling spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)i forked out $60 to try phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  i am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  yes, phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than dark and lovely or tcb, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward.it has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when i use dark & lovely.  i guess i am lucky that my hair responds well to any type of relaxer so i doubt i'll be spending another $60 for phyto2...i'd rather buy two tubes of phytodefrisant balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  i hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  if you do well with drug store brands, phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair",1
okay but does not keep cool for long. i do like the massage effect from the beads,1
"the instructions say, ""use whenever your skin needs a boost.""  it goes on to imply that you will see a result every time you use it - it's not one of these products where you need to use it repeatedly to see results.  i bought it at a big upscale department store and used it that night.  now that winter is approaching, my skin gets a little wacky at times.the product comes out as a gel but becomes creamy as you apply it on the damp skin.  the instructions are to leave it on until a ""full froth"" forms (approximately 5 minutes), then rinse off.the cream began to take on the consistency of foam after about 2 minutes, and at the end of 5 minutes the foam was beginning to dissipate and leave big empty patches on my skin, so i rinsed it off.  my skin didn't look any different when done.  it didn't feel any different when done.  for $52 i expected at least some type of visible change - even if it made my skin redder, or plumper, or something.unfortunately the box is now in the bottom of the trash, so i can't return it.  we have christmas guests coming; maybe one of them will enjoy using it",1
"i bought the entire line of products from the lisa's hair regimen on the carol's daughter website. i took all the products back to sephora yesterday. i used this hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. i washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. i wear my hair natural and i had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. when i took the product back to sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was red w/ white spots all throughout it. i had to take otc pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. the only thing i can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. the product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. if you have allergies to these items i would suggest not using this product. i contacted carol's daughter and have not heard back from them yet. i would have expected more from the company who's product states 'made with love, peace'.",0
"until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave-ins:  it made my dry, curly hair soft, shiny, and smelling great!  but lately something has changed. the once thick, silky liquid has turned thin and watery, with a distinctly alcohol-like smell.  it's so disappointing... this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book.  don't bother with it anymore, unless the original formula comes back",1
"in all honesty, i'd rate the fragrance itself as ""5 stars,"" however, the scent does not last for love nor money, which is why i give it a mere ""1 star.""  you'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and, consequently, before you know it, you've depleted your perfume!  talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and, if they're honest, they will tell you exactly what i've written here.  because i adore the scent, i'm going to try the baby phat goddess body lotion and see if that has a lingering effect",1
"ive had this product for the past 2 weeks and it does not do what it claims to do, i still have to reapply makeup and it still smudges of",1
"i think this product would be great, but wasn't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy's website does't give you one tiny bit of information.  the very last step, the very last sentence says that you shouldn't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout.  the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin",1
"this didn't do anything for me. is it supposed to have very subtle cumulative effect? i am returning it. i'm really surprised others had such great results, because i tried it twice and left it on for double the time, and still it did nothing more than wash my face and maybe moisturize with the cream. it does have more than baking soda and h2o2- also contains catalase, some stearic acid, and some vitamin c. of course, your skin already has its own catalase.",1
this is very expensive for what is essentially hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. which would cost the average person about 3 dollars.,1
"i've read so many positive reviews about this and i wanted to buy it so very much. but when i got around to actually smell it...i was so dissapointed, i can only smell an old lady perfume, a bug spray, i don't know, something so strong and not strong in the right way. my favourites are dior j'adore, red delicious, intuition( estee lauder), try them instead if you want to feel sexy and powerful",1
"small, thin, fragile, not worth the five dollars.  find a better product from another company",1
i got my bottle of curve today and tried it out...  my girlfriend said i smelled like dust.  oops!  too bad they don't have scratch and sniff on the computer..,0
"ok ive been using proactiv 4 about a year now and i have to say that it did work for me well like 90% with one or two breakouts a month so i was pretty pleased about that. people often asked me what i did cuz my change was drastic, so that was nice.one night i styed up late and that murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv, so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day.couple of days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it. few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much, one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead. i knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again. i have now gone back to proactiv and seen improvement so hopefully within the next couple of weeks it will clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under a rock hahaha. my main advice is to really do ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before",1
the product has made my skin much worse than when i started. i am so sorry i  even kept at it!! :(  how can i reverse all the damage now that murad has given me. :*,0
"i purchased the murad acne complex for $40 or so (for a measley one month supply).  i was disgustingly excited to try it, as everything else has failed me.  proactiv works wonderfully for me, but only for the first month or two, then it seems i grow an immunity to it.i paid to have the murad acne complex expedited to me because i was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'  i read the pamphlet, and understood that my skin could go through a ""purging"" phase, where your skin literally purges all of the bacteria and other acne causing assailants.  imagine the worst skin you've ever seen.  imagine the most painful breakouts.  that was my personal ""purging"" process.  it was literally the worst breakout of my entire life.  my husband kept telling me to continue using the products though, because this was expected.  i'm still using the products, and though my skin is better than it was 3 weeks ago, i'm basically back where i was when i started.  i give up.  but i'm not giving up any more money to murad",0
this dryed my skin out really bad and it didn't even work.dont use this,0
"like the others i was disappointed after a couple times using this product.  and like the others i started to breakout where i had not broken out before, on my forehead etc.  i bought this product because i had problem areas.  using this product brought out more problem areas and dried out my skin.  i used the product as prescribed. the commercial said it was gentle and what made this product different from the rest was that it wouldn't cause acne only with it's ""gentle"" formula help it with immediate results.  not true at all.  this is just like any other product on the market for acne.  if you have the weeks of pain and suffering and embarrassing breakouts more than what you had before to get results, this is the product for you.  i, on the other hand, couldn't deal with the additional embarrassment of my skin getting worse before it got better.  when my trouble areas weren't that bad in the first place.not recommended as they advertise.  they aren't different than the others.  proactive does the same thing.",0
"this product should be listed only for people with really oily skin.  it dried my combination skin out so bad that it got red, flaky, and it hurt!  i also got horrible pimples all over my face due to over drying.  this is actually harsher than proactive.. unless your skin covered in oil,  it probably wont be able to handle it.  good luck getting your refund, i'm still waiting for mine.  i also cancelled the shipments twice and they keep charging me and sending them",0
"i first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine. i fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously. i decided when i had some extra cash i would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for christmas. christmas came and went and no fantasy, instead i recieved celine dion's fragrance. i liked the smell of the dion but was still sad that i didn't get what i wanted. i decided to buy the fantasy for myself. upon finding it at a makeup counter i became rather thankful i got the other. i think fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray i had in elementary school. mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again. the bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile. it'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should i be surprised? i suppose the scent caters well to spears' followers, 12 year olds",1
i really wanted to like this one but just couldn't get past the smell.   it was really over-powering.  lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this isn't one of them.  i didn't find it drying though and it did lather very nicely.  it was just too strongly scented for my liking,1
"i didn't know you were supposed to peel that waxy rubbery black stuff off the soap...i normally get store-bought olive oil soap but it smelled so good, i had to try it.  i ended up covered with black, waxy streaks all over my body when i got out of the shower!  they didn't rinse off, either.  the only thing that seemed to work was to rub really vigorously with a towel...i still had black smudges and a wax residue.  once i figured out how to take a knife to the coating, i had a better opinion of the soap, except that it pretty much cut the soap in half.  it smelled really nice, but i don't think i would get this again.",1
"i generally love lush soaps, but do not recommend this one. demon in the dark has a great name, but it doesn't smell very good (a sort of faint, slightly minty scent). it also has a black wax coating that is rather difficult to peel or scrape off, but must be removed for the soap to work properly.  i would try red rooster or karma soap instead",0
"i'm in my 30's, light skin, everybody was talking about this product so i decided to give it a try; didn't work for me, after using it for a while i had break outs and my skin became greasy. it's not what they say it is, i've tried many philosophy products the only one that is what they promised is amazing grace for your body, but the skin care products are a scam, go for neutrogena or clinique , good luc",1
"ick.  i bought ultra light kirsch because i thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that i used to love by loreal.smell - fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out.feel - i like lip gloss that feels glossy.  this stuff did not shine enough or last long enough.color - the color was to mild for me.  i was very disappointed.  i felt like i had wasted money and time. i still recommend loreal lip juice, though. i believe it's the same company, and lip juice is glossy, shiny, long-lasting and way more cost-effective",1
"i had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. not so. the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.i have used many creams. so far art of shaving is the best. casswell massey is ok as is aveda. avoid truefitt.update. trufitt and hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems. they sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as massey. it is good. the standard is still substandard",1
"i thought the product arrived in a timely manner.  the instructions were clear, but it's hard to hold the stencils and put on your eyebrow at the same time.  not a bad product for the price",1
"i received this as a christmas gift and loved the smell of it.  after my second time using it, i broke out in a terrible itchy rash. there is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation.  do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin.  the smell is great, but is gone after you get out of the shower.",0
"i just used this product in a bath. it's supposed to be a cinnamon smelling bubble bath, shampoo rinse, shower gel. well first of all, i almost had to swallow my own lungs to smell any cinnamon, this is really weak smelling. (i am a real scent meister too.) i used it as a bubble bath, guess what? the bubbles were gone within minutes. stick with the avon bubble bath, it still has bubbles in the tub when you are done! then i used it as a shampoo. guess what? it didn't lather! i ended up using the trusty suave to finish the bath. very disapointing product! i bought the 32oz. for myself as a christmas present, can't wait till it's gone",1
"i have worked with two women who have worn this perfume, and frankly, i can't stand the smell of it. it doesn't even smell like perfume, it is like some bizarre animal musk. there are no floral notes, and no woodsy notes, either; nothing clean or fresh or pleasant. i wish this perfume didn't exist---i hate it.",0
i had such high hopes for this product. i thought it was going to be the perfect scent for me. as it turns out that couldn't be futher from the truth. it smells like cheap old lady perfume. yuck. to top it all off they raised the price of it by 5 dollars!! talk about inflation. ouch!,1
"when i think of an almond cookie, i think of something sweet, especially given the description of this product.  the smell of almond is so overpowering, its all i can smell.  i didn't catch vanilla or sandalwood.  i've already returned my products",1
i ordered this item. all of your information indicated that it was in stock. the company shipped another product instead. the mirror i wanted was out of stock. i never received any information so i ended up paying more from another vendor and still didn't have the mirror for christmas. i am so disappointed with amazon and bebeautiful,0
i have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer.  i used just a little bit and it was really greasy.  i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum.  it works much better,1
"i wouldn't recommend this product to a person with long hair like myself. after using this so called ""instant detangler"" my hair was more tangled then ever. in my opinion any cheap hair conditioner from a drug store will do a better job",1
"i was very unhappy with this product. first the shipping took way too long. second, the tube is much smaller than sold at macy's and the cost is more. and the contents were gross, very goopy. not smooth. like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. i'll fight the mall to buy this next time",0
"i love, love, love, lipglass normally.  but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go-go dancer.",1
"my sister-in-law bought this product for me after i had admired the shade (purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. i have used other mac products before with great results, but was very dissapointed with this product. first of all, i gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. however, this product is sticky. very sticky! it does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. when i wear a lip gloss, i want to be soft and smooth feeling. i want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. this will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  this product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, i would never reccomend this to anyone",1
"this product will claim to be on the same level of the tools that dermatologists use to extract blackheads.  but don't count on any instructions included to tell you how to use this little rod. i did some searching on the internet for a clue, and all directions simply said you press the loop firmly against the blackhead to extract the comedones.  well that left a red circle on my face and made tears come out of my eyes ...but left the blackhead firmly in place.if there is a better way to use this tool i highly doubt it will produce effective results.  there is simply nothing unique or different about the little metal loops than the end of your fingers.  don't waste your money on this pathetic product",0
"it only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is not the solution for ending blackheads/enlarged pores. using this ""extractor"" is equal to using one's fingers to squeeze out imperfections, which may produce very temporary results, but is ultimately fruitless. those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep-cleaning instead, which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation",1
"i was very unhappy with this product. first the shipping took way too long. second, the tube is much smaller than sold at macy's and the cost is more. and the contents were gross, very goopy. not smooth. like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. i'll fight the mall to buy this next time",0

"i used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend. my face, esp. my forehead became very greasy, and every pore on my forehead became inflamed. i thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina. my face cleared up instantly. when the aquamarina ran out i went back to herbalism, but -surprise- the skin problems reemerged. now, i'm using aquamarina instead and love it, though you can't get it through amazon for some reason. check the lush website. i'm sure this won't happen to everyone, but give that pink glop a try instead",1
"disappointingly, this tape did not perform as well as hoped. it was unable to hold medium or heavier weight fabrics in place. using a one-inch piece under bra straps did not keep them from slipping, the tape and straps eventually started rolling. and it definitely was unable to help prevent a strapless bra from succumbing to newton's law of gravity! so not only did fashion faux-pas continue to occur, the tape caused a rash/skin irritation with each use.",1
"if you have some respect for your nose, please don't buy these wipes!!! i bought these thinking that maybe it would have a nice soft smell, but these thing has more than enough perfume to stink your whole house!!! and i would never put it on the delicate skin of my baby",1
"these wipes have more perfume in them than any wipe on earth.  they are about the same softness as the kirkland brand, but cost a lot more.  and wooohoooo, they smell stronger than este lauder herself",1
"at 23, i don't have ""age"" wrinkles around my eyes, but i have laugh lines that i want to soften. this product has done nothing for my laugh lines. i could have spent the same amount of money on something else that works. skin growth factors available on ebay helped rebuild the skin in the creases of my laugh lines. this product did not.",1
"i was talked into buying this product for minor fine lines. this product that i used for 4 months, showed no signifigant results as well as any other product ive used by estee lauder. dont waste your money on it. i usually look at it like this. if any cosmetic retailer offer a free gift with purchase it usually needs one to go with it. this product is crap!",1
"that's the drawback of buying a new thing on the internet because you can not feel or smell it. i bought the whole set as i am a sandalwood fanatic. i couldn't have been more disappointed, this thing whatever it is does not smell like sandalwood. a complete waste of money",0
"why did shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub-par spf? they got the broad spectrum part correct by using avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred spf 15. uva/uvb spf 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists, the skin cancer foundation, the american academy of dermatology, and others. plus, as a moisturizer, this one is just ok. there are far better formulations on the market, even some made by shiseido, containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients",1
"although this worked well on some of my blackheads, i felt it was very harsh to my skin.  i was worried that using it would create even more scars.  i would not buy this product again.",0
"used daily for 3 months. minimal improvement in dark circles, zero improvement in lines around eye area (i am 35 years old). i hope this is not the best product out there",1
"i bought tendskin to help with the irritation and razor bumps i get on my neck from shaving. the product claims to, ""reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and redness from shaving."" but despite it's lofty promises and high price, it does none of this. in fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse, i have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol. the directions tell you to apply it after shaving, but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving, it only made my problem worse. i wish i could have rated this product zero stars, because it is absolutely worthless",0
i used tend skin for a few years and it was the best one that i could find but a few weeks ago i saw a nother product on amazon called solution 2 and ordered it instead.  i was a little worried because i was getting good results with the bumps with tend skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit.  solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps,1
for medium length hair it lasted about 4 uses.  smells way funky.  can't say i noticed anything different.just didn't feel that it warrants the hype,0
"i used this product a few times, trying to justify the money i spent.  i could leave it on my hair all day, and the effect was essentially zilch.  hair is dead.  it doesn't matter what propaganda beauty/cosmetics companies use to promote their products, there is no way that vitamins, minerals, etc. are going to ""feed"" or strengthen your hair.  when the products are washed out, so is the moisture.  it was a dumb idea on my part to think putting guacamole on my hair was going to make it a)smell good b)feel good.  and it was really dumb of me to pay so much for this stuff when i could've just as easily and much more cheaply made it myself",0
"i think i may have had a bad batch because when i read the reviews on how yummy it had smelled, made me curious. so, i tried it and i hated it! the smell of it turned my stomach. it did soften my hair a bit, but i don't recommend using it again. sorry lush",0
"let me just say that i have thick, dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp. and this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess. it dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage. the smell was really good at first, very coconuty. but then after a few uses it developed a weird scent, like playdoh and pepper. so i just used up the rest of it as regular soap. it has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars",1
"i tried phyto index #1 and basically, its a waste of cash.  you can get the same deal at the grocery store and it'll probably do a better job.  let me describe my hair.  i am black, my hair is thin and breaks easily.  i can not have too heavy moisterizers because it weighs my hair down i will lose the bounce in my hair, so i always use serum.  i style my hair by blow drying and using a ceramic flat iron to get it straight, flowing, and bouncy.  the relaxer almost seem like it didn't take.  i haven't had a relaxer to do that in ages. i put this in almost a month ago and i can't wait until it grows out to put some real relaxer in.  also, everytime i would do a touch up, my hair would stop shedding.  with phyto index #1, it sheds more!  with breakage strands.  i'm ok with root strands shedding, that's natural.  next time, i will either order mitzani relaxer online or go to a professional to put that in.  mitzani is one of my favorites.  number #1 is silk ii (i have no idea how to get that).  as for homekits, optimum is good.",1
"i was really excited for this! i hoped it would be a faster, easier way to do make up and what not, but its not.it smears like crazy, and the end is so sharp, it hurts to apply. but that doesn't matter!the end stops working after a use or two.i suppose if you wanted to do make up similar to a raccoon with blueish eyes (for the black is more navy then black) you'll be happy.i've always loved the mark products, but this is a disappointment",1
this stuff has great shine. but it dries my lips and it starts peeling. and uber sticky,1
"at first it smells very sharp and citrusy, almost like men's cologne. then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal. after 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. you'd be better off buying a bottle of herbal essence shower gel and getting identical results",1
"i bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. this product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. it did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. it stinks so bad, i did not want to go near her after i wiped her down...i had to give her a bath, it was so bad",0
"the beads in this ice pack do not get cold at all. it gets a little cold, but warms up in about 45 seconds. i also noticed very little over all effects from using it",1
"i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume! like all the lush bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong strong smell. i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore.so yeah, if you love love loooooooove patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one.i love lush, but not this bar",1
"i ordered the ""fedora"".  i am so dissapointed, it came off within a few hours!  just peeled right off. do not order this brand of fingernail polish. it is the worst i have ever used",0
"i've ordered this product a month ago.  i had mild acne, i've used a lot of benzoyl peroxide products etc persagel, clearasil, etc.  one day i saw a commerical for this murad product, which looked too good to be true.  i've ordered the product because the price was cheaper than some of the other products and it had ""real people"" saying the product worked.  i did follow the instructions on the 3 products.  less than a week, my face broke out even more, i had some cystic acne which i never had before.  it was astonishing, but the company said there was a ""purging"" state, which i held out hope that it would be a minor setback.  2 weeks later, again i started breaking out on both sides of my face and under my neck and chin area.  i am so dumbfounded that this product said it would make a difference within a month.  it's been 1 month and 3 weeks and i am so disappointed.  i've stop using this product for the last 3 days and my skin is getting better and i've cancelled any future products from this company.  don't recommend it",0
"i developed mild acne after deciding to go off of my regular birth control pill.  never having acne before, this was devistating.  i watched all the infomercials and decided to go with murad's acne complex kit expecting the glowing, perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks.  i purchased the starter kit and i liked the smell of the products but after a month and a half, i was still experiencing bad breakouts.  i even had the really painful acne that are so deep it takes weeks for them to come to the surface!  i continued to use the second shipment of murad because everything i read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks.  i spent 3 months and over $60 on this stuff without results.  silly me, i was going to order more but i started reading reviews for my only alternative, proactiv.  now that stuff isn't any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned acne free in their review and i figured that it was worth a try.  i found it at my local walreens for $19.  let me tell you, i used acne free for 2, two, days and saw results that i had not seen in 3 months of using the expensive stuff.  i can't say enough about it.  i'm thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product.  goes to show, don't buy from t.v.",1
"i have to write in caps because i am so irritated.  i have tried 5 different carol's hair products and none including this one has worked.  not only that the smells aren't all that great and they scream.  it's like people who wear bad perfume that's extremely strong, but smells horrible, they think it smells good but it disgust everyon",0
wasn't anything special. you can go to any beauty supply store and get a similar oil that's half the price.,1
"this book has its good points. if anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. the online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. this messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. i am not just in denial. i have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the keirsey temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. so, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.as for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, i'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. the company i work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.your money can be spent better elsewhere. i say its only worth about $10",1
"the fatalistic view of conservativism is expressed by kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, ""[edmund] burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which providence has prepared man"".  but wait. the conservative mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of america with ward and june cleaver and normal rockwell. meanwhile, burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. what a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.there are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. kirk writes, ""what men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well"" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. the author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. is it so surprising that kirk lauds some of the worst racists in american history like nathanial bedford forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? in a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate john c. calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises john randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. kirk goes on about calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the fugitive slave act which forced federal officials and law officials in northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. he supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. for calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. one wonders if kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. the duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. quoting samuel coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. sounding like the inspiration for disgraced chief justice roy moore, russell kirk urges that, ""state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law"". kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of god but never draws a distinction. i have to wonder if, like the modern reconstructionist, kirk wanted to see the laws of leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. he never explains how one might recognize a law of god besides using prejudice.the third thread would be kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. he refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of god in prejudice and tradition. `prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for god and those in higher stations and authority.in order to grab the golden fleece of populism conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. like calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete. i found russell kirk's salesmanship of conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day.",1
"i was intrigued by the title, which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity.  well, after 60 pages or so, i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that. the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life.  but, i say that any religious life (be it christian, islam or otherwise) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional. i am convinced that yoda is a zen master; the force is derived from tao, not god as interpreted by the orthodox religion(i am purposefully leaving out christian mysticism, which is another beast altogether.). a better book on the subject of theology in star wars is ""the dharma of star wars.""",0

"noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the united states of america.  he has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  his world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u.s., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states.  he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy.  he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the u.s. and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  his distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the ""underdog,"" even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah.  yet since 1955, hypocrite chomsky has worked for the ""overdog"" massachusetts institute of technology, which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of war and mass destruction, and continues to this very day.chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the united states and the jewish state.if he were not so attached to the freedom of making money, earning the adulation of the american left, and freedom to express himself, he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in north korea, iran, or syria.  let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much, the united states of america.  god bless america, which will continue to give chomsky the right to speak, teach, and make lots of money.raybo",1

""...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours.""  even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted.  i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little",0
"heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein's final books.  we are also treated to some of heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  as if this isn't enough, heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  in spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  this novel, as well as most of heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption",1

"how can a best-selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? one answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon. simon and the raccoons; simon on the failing american economy; simon attempting to reproduce american accents. this is a cd set for avoiding",0
"i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters. he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for ""the swede"", without letting us know who the swede really is. roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration.it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times",1

"i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. from that time on, until august 20th 2002, i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time. i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: ""let freedom ring"" with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. i loved it, couldn't be more happy.well, the day of the book's release, i took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. it looked better than i ever imagined.with the flag on the cover and the title of ""let freedom ring,"" i thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. i expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. maybe some firework sound effects. boy was i wrong. i opened the book only to the colors black and white. no red. no blue. no stars and stripes. i quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. i found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks. at that point, i went into a 4 year long depression. i nearly committed suicide at several points. it's only now that i can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is. i say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. there are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects. i have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. i went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much i love america and the stars and stripes, suggested i have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made. the methodoloy was simple: a book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest. we found some very good books and they did cheer me up. the one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called ""president jesus: how jesus wrote the constitution, freed the slaves, and won world war ii."" its published by a small church in texas. i was very proud of my students for finding it. it has brought countless joy to my life. along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. i'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. i've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. people even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house. now i often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling.",1

"the book jacket for ""the ruins"" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad american tourists at play in mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  it's the stuff of great summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  but 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.  almost immediately, you'll notice that smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  however, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.  next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  there are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  there is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  this seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  by the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.  and for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the rocky mountains, the saharan desert, or anywhere else.  the danger posed has nothing to do with mexico, archeology or mythology at all.  ah yes, the danger posed.  well, i can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  the numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say ""i read this many pages for this?"".by the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  the characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.  this book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  it could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  but none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.",0

"this book is offensive to at least one of the two genders, though it's hard to say which. it suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot, more or less. whether that's more insulting to the male brain or the female body, i'm not sure, but the book portrays neither gender realistically.i like heinlein, and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential, but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass, and it's not even particularly good at being that.the gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so, but heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature. more's the pity",0
"why in the world would anyone publish a writer's bread and butter notes to his agent?  besides the money, i mean.  there are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom heinlein feels did him dirty.  but in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master.  just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published",1

"first of all, i did not exactly 'read' this biography. instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books).i had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln. i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed. i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson, richard carwardine, or doris goodwin. i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character. in this context, i find mr mccullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america. i also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams' time, and i missed 'hearing' the voice of john adams. instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin.all in all, my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. had i known that, i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough's fictional work",1

"nothing in this book was usable for me.  okay, very little.  if i was trying to write the next _ethan frome_, then this book would be perfect.  instead i write sci-fi and fantasy.  i was looking for tips to improve my description of things; this book recommends describing different things.  too much emphasis on metaphor (which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious).  if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate, this book might be a waste of your time.  however, poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than i did",1

"i was expecting this book to be a great story, but very disappointed. i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is. the book is insipid and dull,  has no flow, no story, or no plot. let me present an example. i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan. for example, sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way, ""if talk is getting cheaper, why did mci worldcom pay $115 billion to buy sprint? the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world. can regulators handle the complex new order.....""  it has a clear logical axis, and has a force to attract readers into it. but jeter describes it like this,  ""the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity. the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit....."" it always presents off-center, trivial detail which makes a reader bored. 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact, like ""the merger of company a & b raised the stock to $x"" etc. there is no insight here. but unfortunately, unlike enron scandal, there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal. you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week, if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost.",0

"ethan mordden's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book.  this is the worst of his books on the various decades of the broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs.  his political ramblings (often just slightly right of ann coulter and making as much sense) seep through the book, dragging it down.  the french people are slammed a number of times, along with the aclu, burt lancaster (apparently, according to ethan a good friend of stalin) and the left in general, while the author defends bush (and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre).  the author's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man  all over the page in search of a target, any target.  it is often hard to stomach.  the truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that, it can actually make one want to look at the work again.  an editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public.  the author is capable of better work",1
"the scientific method applied to this book:1) form a hypothesis:  great managers do something differently than mediocre managers.2) conduct an experiment:  interview 80,000 managers.3) analyze data: ???this step is missing???4) draw conclusions: write this book.with the exception of the ""12 questions"", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  they make several insightful statements, such as ""many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes.""  however, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  does ""many managers"" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like ""many managers"" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed i 100 managers is a negligible amount.  the entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.  it seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  however, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  if buckingham and coffman didn't claim this book was a result of ""the largest study of its kind,"" i would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, i wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.",1
"this book was on a very interseting topic. the author took time in studying this topic. it was about the impending world oil shortage. that is the time when we, the world, will run out of oil. it tells you about hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. then they talk about where oil is. they also talk about drilling for oil. they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. then they talk about the size of oil fields. they also reexamine hubbert's analysis later on in the book. rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody. the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about.i wouldn't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage. i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring. when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring. i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book",0

"john updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  but his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  when he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.and certainly, the rewards have come.  but for readers outside the us at least, it's all a little mystifying.  john cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by americans as the lesser canon.  time will correct this mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this.if i still have your attention, let me recommend the 'collected stories' of john cheever.  updike could only dream of writing prose like that.",1

"the setting of this book is beautiful, exotic, and interesting. the author, unfortunately, does nothing to take advantage of this. i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award. it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which i doubt. the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else, as far as i am concerned. i can't imagine it being done worse! tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. i felt completely detached from all of the characters. i didn't feel like i gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. another thing that completely irritated me were tuck's sexual references. throughout the novel, tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest, for example). these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. i don't know what tuck was trying to do in this novel. i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: it is not entertaining. it is not profound. it is not educational. it is not beautiful. at only 248 pages, i can't say it was even a quick read. utterly forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it.",0

"i didn't know why i chose to read this book. anyway, it was disappointing, really. the book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. i mean, i think the book could go on without some of the parts. when i was reading it, i only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. i thought the plot was shallow, but taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. he kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! he was a coward. if you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise. he was acting really immature! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish. it really sucked.and yes, i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. and what did i find? nothing. oh, what a waste. it's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.if it hadn't been for my hrr (home reading report) i wouldn't have finished reading this at all.i guess i'm saying this because i'm not into this genre. love stories are fine but this one... nah",0

"the author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a right-wing think tank. like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. most in the west do care. rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment. though the author's real target is us society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. and of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us. in the us, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. in actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. in this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the wal-mart juggernaut. he especially decries direct citizen actions. he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. however, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. it's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums. if citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie. his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? no, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it. if the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. the list could go on. informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore. it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.",1

"the author makes a couple of valuable points. first, any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent ""secular"" (i.e., indefinitely long) bear markets. most leading investment advisors recommend a ""buy and hold"" strategy, but this only works during predominately bull market periods. most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market, which is anomalous in historical terms. the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that ""buy and hold"" doesn't always provide the best returns. obviously, then, it's better to pull out during the bear markets, but that's easier said than done. the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets, including p/e ratio, interest and inflation rates, and gdp. the problem is that those characteristics don't always correlate with market performance. for example, this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market. well, if you heeded his advice, you would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005 and early 2006, especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks. even with high p/e ratios, a bull market can continue for several years: witness the late 90s. it's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis. there is so much volatility on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis that's it's impossible to know when the market has switched directions. by the time that it is apparent, it's too late to profit. even in the midst of great bull markets, there might be week, month, or even year-long downturns. the author says nothing about individual stock picking, beyond a general value approach. the book is all about big picture, long term trends. another problem is that the author's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900. but the market (and economy) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. as they say, past performance does not predict future returns. the investment advice provided here is not useful. he suggests a ""portfolio of hedge funds,"" ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k. he also recommends a ""bond ladder,"" an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund, and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations. i don't need to spend $25 and five hours reading to learn that!one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility, which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations. volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for. most studies just average the returns across years, but that doesn't reflect real returns. let's say you invest $100k into a stock that returns 35% the first year and -15% the second. your average return should be 10% a year, right? wrong. at the end of the first year you have 135k. minus 15% the second year leaves you with 115k total, equal to 7% a year compounded. if you had received 10% a year compounded, your final total would be over 121k. that's 6k difference in just 2 years, and the volatility costs add up.the book is very poorly written, plodding, sooooo boring, with tons of repetition. just as an example, the graph showing the ""y curve"" relationship between p/e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times.",1

"the amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives.  i had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948.  i am not questioning mosley's portrayal of racism.  however, i did a little research into just how violent place los angeles was in 1948, and the answer is not very.  there may have been poverty, racism, alcholism, but l.a. county seemed pretty safe; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find, 1827!  mosley may have been more familiar with l.a. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way.  throw in speakeasies, gangsters hijacking liquor trucks, and one gets the impression that mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928.i am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate.  but many, many people hail mosley for depicting a dark side of life/era/place that had not been shown before.  from what i can tell, he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s (i guess those years average to be about 1948).  mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation.  however, i doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic, and i hope readers realize that it is not.easy rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak, but unfortunately large, group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting.  a detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect; that is interesting to read.  detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via  confession.  easy does solve one of the murders on his own, but just about everything he ""solves"" is simply confessed to him.  i find that extremely dissatisfying.mosley has packed the book with violence, but seems to know very little about violence himself.  none of the fights are well described.  easy, for being a self-professed ""killing machine"" can't actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them.  they are either big or they are small.  he does not come of as being hard-boiled, but rather a pathetic braggartmosley does show signs of being a very good writer.  but i think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional.  i imagine that his work must have improved, but this effort is nothing to get exceited over.  and again, i don't obsess over accuracy, but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel.",1
"i wonder if jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel. one cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a tom clancy or john d. macdonald style just because that's what film-going audiences like. i do not think this is a bad thing, but i, like some of the reviewers here, are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i.e., macdonald's &quot;cape fear,&quot; or use that tired native american romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof. as for her writing style, she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. what we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the walker parents, davy, his fiancee, and to some extent, lani, who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding medicine woman. her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. the men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke. i kept seeing jance speaking for them. so we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for hollywood to call and possibly star penelope cruz as lani walker. what's the tohono o'otham word for &quot;2 thumbs down?&quot",0

"gary zukav states in his introduction ""i had never studied physics. in fact i didn't like science and i had no mathematical aptitude.on opra (tv) he admitted that he does not have a tv which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.i noticed that some reviewers refer to the ""new physics"" is that like ""new age"" or voodoo physics? 90% of the matter must be missing from this book. or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. he even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose. many people say they did not understand physics until this book; surprises, you still do not. you now know what zukav wished physics was. take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. and the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.at least get it straight before mixing it up. try reading some of these:""the ascent of man by jacob bronowski"". the book available everywhere the dvd's available from the uk.""the upanishads"" by eknath easwaran (editor), michael n. nagler (photographer)or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner:""the tao of physics: an exploration of the parallels between modern physics and eastern mysticism"" by fritjof capra.also on the fringe but not as radical as zukav is a series called ""what the bleep.""

"[the above is an actual quote from the book]i don't usually read romances, but got this one at the library.  i thought: thriller.  hijacked plane, navy seal...all the right stuff.and the beginning was promising.  stan fixes everything, and has a human side to him that was compelling.then the plot hit the fan!  as a thriller it stunk.  the highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly, as an after thought.  the romantic ""tension"" between the protagonists was forced and irritating.  the dialogue is mundane.  the message that horniness leads to true romantic (sam and alyssa) love is rubbish.the only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl, and i think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed.the historic (wwii) componant was interesting.but overall, i kept asking who the audience is for this book.  not lovers of thrillers like me--and i wonder, do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane, or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether teri will ever tell sam that she loves him!",1
"i ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.  nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a christian book, espousing christian dogma and assumptions.  i'm surprised this is acceptable for use by government funded public schools.  furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition.  i'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising.  some of the parenting tips are common sense that i didn't think needed to be reiterated.  a person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down.  i was looking for more than that.  the advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation, how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process.there is false logic in some of the parental mistakes.  an example is always attributing ""hovering parents"" to ego issues, that a parent ""needs to be needed"".  some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger.  false assumptions leads to false conclusions.  i gave this  2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense.  but it isn't helping my family.",0
"i found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents. i flipped though it and it looked dated, but interesting, so i decided to get it.as other reviewers mention, it is dated -- but you gotta know that up front when you get it. it's published in 1986, when there were no (well, almost no) home computers. so you have to accept up front that it's talking about organizing papers using more papers -- but that's something we still all got to do occasionally.so it's a system of notepads, file folders, etc. it does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers, etc, and what you can do about it. however, it does get overly complex, and really doesn't seem applicable in today's world, where there are far fewer ""homemakers"" who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files, as this book seems to be focused on.finally, i have to mention that it was the continual religion-related references that put me off to the book in the end. others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it, but for me, i felt i was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable. just my personal taste; i'm sure some others will disagree with this judgement, but i have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text, i gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin",1
"before i bought the pasajes series, i was relieved to see the (then) mostly positive reviews.  however, i really feel like the overall review score of 4.5 stars is very, very misleading.  i would not, in good faith, be able to recommend this series of books for learning spanish.  this series of books was very confusing and extremely difficult to work with.  some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish:1) the concepts are not clearly explained (they invented a ""new"" english word for one) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary/concepts to feel confident using them.  2) frequently, new words, phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else, via a footnote, with no further explaination provided!!  this is super frustrating and distracting!3) using this series of books is very cumbersome, the books are not well coordinated with one another, and do not appear to reinforce each other's concepts or vocabulary.i'm very sorry, but these books are just terrible, and 4.5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books... using this series of books has taken all the fun out of learning spanish, which i used to enjoy.  if you have the option to use different books, take it",1

"a generation before there was a left behind, there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c. c. carlson. this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america. a phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry. for many christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. a generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other ""prophecy pundits."" while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book.part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. for lahaye and jerry b. jenkins, it was the pulp novel. back in 1970, lindsay and c. c. carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. like most books of this type (e.g., the bermuda triangle, chariots of the gods?, the philadelphia experiment, the population bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes, i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. after all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a ufo invasion, a famine around the corner, and california falling into the pacific ocean, the authors' claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy.however, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. make a bad prediction? no problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book the 1980's: countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief). well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon (another of his books was planet earth 2000 a.d.: will mankind survive?). oops, wrong again. first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam (a more recent book is the everlasting hatred: the roots of jihad). when one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies ""right before our eyes"", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the left behind series of novels.if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night.however, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. for all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil. for this, its original purpose, the late great planet earth is completely worthless.",1

"""dark tort"" was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read, but for a novel that's supposed to be part of a quirky, light mystery series, i found things a bit leaden.  the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered, and when we finally do move beyond that scene, a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further.  i do admit that it also doesn't help that i'm one of those people who can't suspend disbelief and have to ask, ""...so she's an off-site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified?""  but, that's just me.  oh, well... many of the recipes did sound good, though i doubt i'll get around to making any of them.this is one of those reviews where it's probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series (which i personally haven't read but suspect aren't much different than this one), you'll likely enjoy this installment, too.  the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b. parker ""spenser"" novel for our light mystery fix.",1

"apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to rawls and bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). to look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and justice, according to rawls' formula). if the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral justice, again, according to rawls. because, according to rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. how? by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. so those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. so those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because ""society"" (the robin hoods and rawls of the world) deemed this as moral justice. rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an ""a"" vs. students who earn an ""f"". he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. true. but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. forcing the ""wealthier"" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't justice or moral. it would simply be an unjust law. some people see rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism). i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. in a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). curious. how do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? there should be societal incentives to help each other. okay. but when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?",1

"first off i'd like to tell you that this is only the second star wars book i've ever read, 'jedi search' being the first. i actually liked the first book, it drew upon the star wars lore well and was a decent read. however, this book made me groan in so many places that i felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it (be warned, this may contain a few spoilers). thusly:how much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions? it reminds me of a 'little britain' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the bible out to make up the space! i don't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to the point!for some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to 'ground' the story by constantly relating to the star wars films. for example, when wedge and the scientist go to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there, he says something along the lines of: i was actually in the cantina in mos eisley when luke met han and chewbacca, little did i know the brush i had with history there.... gahhhhhhh!!! why!? how did he know!? it didn't need it!! *bangs head on desk*he does this throughout the two books i've read so far!! how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without 'proving' that it's true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films?then there's admiral daala. made an admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking.... so what is she doing in this? she's reviewing recordings of speeches given by tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing! it's only the end of the second book and she's down to 1 star destroyer! she should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens. (i.e. the rebellion win)he then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea, that of having a jedi academy (the point of the trilogy!). there's so much that could have been done here - new and original training for the jedi, but no - he has the jedi go two-by-two into the forest (holding hands?) to *sense* things... it's meant to be a sci-fi series! something could have been done to make this so much better!i was incensed to find that luke was actually made 'boring' in this book. part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how luke had grown. it all started very promisingly in the first book, having learnt that luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever! (cool! i thought). it got to the stage where i'd dread coming back to the jedi parts of the story because he was so dull.the other trainee jedi needed serious character development (they were 1 dimensional!) - entering every scene with luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just wasn't good enough.as other reviewers have said - one of his students goes rogue, somehow gains the knowledge of building a super-lightsabre (great idea btw!! we need more of that!) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters... and luke just meditates about it!? *grr*okay all that being said it was 'okay' and on the strength of the first book i will be reading the next book (it's like a car accident - you've just got to look!).",1
"no doubt about it.  this book covers the history of the border patrol.  however, it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a ""fluff piece"" than anything else.as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent (13 years) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency, i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity).  pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least), appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target.  his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (i apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial.  did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed?  if so, then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else.  if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security.  simply put, the border patrol, as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating.  remember the incompetence of fema (a homeland security subcomponent)?  well, multiply that incompetence times ten.  heard about the poor morale of fema employees?  multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol.  a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out.  those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs.  the bottom line is that as a former agent, i lose sleep at night knowing what i know.   pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda.  that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u.s. border patrol agent.  the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits.  read the book for enjoyment and homage.  just don't expect critical analysis.  in fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge (for you ib agents in san diego).",0
"when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith, i ordered it the same day.  after all, we seemed to be following the same path.  i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning.  then i found christ as a 40-year-old.  my transition was from a semi-serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian.  hearing about dr. collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued.his book should be entitled ""a politician presents evidence for belief"".  it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research.  the human genome project is elevated to status of ""bridge to a momentous new era"".  hogwash.  hype is the term i would use.  the dept. of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources.  the author couldn't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk dna' than previously thought.dr. collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma.  this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school.  this is not entirely his fault, however, since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn't perfectly gradual and perfectly random.  their motivation should be perfectly obvious, but it's not even on dr. collins' radar.  he also uses mendel's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics, assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel's data was `dry-labbed'.usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology.  dr. collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology: st. augustine and  c.s. lewis.  i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a ""lyrical and allegorical flavor"".  i would include the book of jonah in that category as well.  however, there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked.the only time dr. collins makes a strong case for anything, it is to refute edward o wilson, richard dawkins, and their minions.  even then, he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism.  francis collins is the consummate politician--he takes a stand without offending anyone.  dr. collins knows that jesus was not a politician, and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time. take this quote from mat 23:14 ""woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.""  dr. collins' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists.  in my opinion it is a  piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth.",1
"even if somehow bin laden did pick up this book and for some reason decide to read it he would not stick with it to learn the lesson that his victims are real average struggling people.  the fictional letter/diary to bin laden from the mother of a fictional attack victim from an arsenal-chelsea soccer game which eleven suicide bombers interrupted is so boring bin laden would give it away before learning what the author wants him to.  the mother just waffles on and on and on and on and on taking forever to get to the point of what she wants to say in any paragraph.  if bin laden is ever captured maybe force him to read this as torture or something.  also why does chris cleve chose to glorify bin ladden by crediting him with a new attack when lets face it he hasn't achieved much since september 11 2001 other than be the world hide and seek champion cowering in a cave somewhere.  this book would have been more realistic and made more sense as a letter to the ira, hezbollah, hamas, islamic jihad or one of the current more frequently operating groups. alternatively base it on a fictional mother of a fictional character on one of the planes or in the world trade centre.  a good concept for a book but poorly written and to be quite frank, extremely boring!",0
"i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling. while reh was first and foremost a story teller, pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades. this, as previous reviewers have mentioned, creates a large gap between reader and story. but why do this? why use such a crappy method of story telling? i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue. all in all, it's a slow, uninspired, day dream story. so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews.i want my money back",0

"having been a fan of antonia fraser for many years, i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie-antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. she depicts marie-antoinette's mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. it seems to me that marie-antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more. she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france. if marie-antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. with all of her enemies at court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. on a smaller scale, fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie-antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that i have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where lady fraser's life ends and where marie-antoinette's life begins. i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie-antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. especially, since marie-antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor. sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language. one can only hope that the works of bertieres, chalon, and delorme will soon be translated and published in english. fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever's travesty",0
"obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  i am not one of them.  perhaps it's because i don't care for science fiction.  i found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a twilight zone cliche.  if, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed.",0

"oh dear. this is another book like the horrible ""who moved my cheese?"" that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children.like the aforementioned ""who thinks my cheese stinks?"" (or whatever it is called), i saw some people in the organisation where i work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days.it's all about making work ""fun"". yep, work can be ""fun"". tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases.of course, it's just great ""fun"" to deal with children who have just had their parents killed, or folks who just lost their kids.because that's what work is - ""fun"" - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers.of course in the examples i have listed above, it doesn't really work too well, because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be ""fun"".myself, i do have some ""fun"" at work, but probably like many people with more than one brain cell, it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us.you can call this cynicism, which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb ""fish""-style ""work must be fun"" philosophy. i'd call it black humour, but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable.as to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace ""fun"" in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise.first immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as ""fun"".second, let them know that they now ""choose"" their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or not), they are ""letting the team down"" and not complying with the obligation to ""make work fun"".third, while the majority of victims or workers, however you choose to view your prey, swallow the ""work is fun"" message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of fish, you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not having fun at work and use the enron-style message that they ""just don't get it"".in this way, the resistant individual can be said to be ""incompatible with our mission and values"", ""bad for morale"" or just ""out of step"".in this way, the ""fun-loving"" workers, who have now taken on the costume of ""forced false fun"" can be set against them.of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign.this book is useful then, if you wish to convince idiots that their ""work is fun"".just don't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously.they might tell you to stick your ""fish"" where the sun doesn't shine",1
"this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework. writing a book is no small feat, and technical books are a special beast.with that last statement in mind, this is were the book sadly falls short. for one, the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books' code. the authors explain ( on the publisher site ) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print. while improvement is always good, this presents two problems. 1. the sample application is now out of sync with the material. not a good thing for those trying to learn, as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book. also, and this is not to disparage the authors skill, but i buy books because i am expecting experienced, if not expert advice. if a small, sample application needs rewriting, perhaps they should write about something else?further down this road, the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling. i suspect that the final build file was not tested, or it was a case of ""well, it compiles on my machine"". there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled. thankfully, i use eclipse and imported the project. eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies, which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive. examples are:jakarta-commons/collections, and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access.for an experienced developer, familiar with ant and a good ide, it was not a lot of trouble to get it running, it just did not give me a good impression.bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql: first, no matter what db you swap in, you'll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file. i made property variables which i placed in build.properties. then you will need to change the class user to something else ( and of course anything in the app that references it. ). another great reason to use eclipse. why you must change it, is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you can't name a table user",1
"this series may be good for a laugh. some of the writing is engaging. but the premise is absurd. why, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the bible? a book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of mt. sinai? in a sense, bible believers have been ""left behind"" since the 1700s enlightenment. tom paine's ""the age of reason"" showed the god of the bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. and what did thomas jefferson call the book of revelations? ""the ravings of a madman."" read this series, if you like. enjoy parts of it. but make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god. do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? when the ""sheep"" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. so heaven is a nudist colony? the basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural. but why should we care whether any of the ""good"" guys gets killed? and why should they mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? that's what they want, isn't it? why even lift a finger against the ""bad"" guys -- didn't christ say, ""resist not evil""? worried about who will win? ""god"" is infinitely powerful. so jesus (who is 1/3 of god -- or something like that) is sure to win when armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. and the ""sheep"" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts jehovah's witnesses leave at your door. the going price for a used copy of ""tribulation force"" is one cent. does that tell you something? actually, the story-telling is worth more. the basic premise is worth less. perhaps it averages out",1
"it took two people to write this book? i was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but this book really was a waste of my time. you can see the ending a mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. it was the writing. the main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in an overly quippy, aren't-i-clever with my snappy dialog way. nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). real people just don't talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. by the way, my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. i won't bother with it",1
"eugene o'neill's play ""long day's journey into night"" is a pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater, i did not enjoy reading this play. the tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion. the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. no happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. ""long day's journey into night"" is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without. however, after learning more about eugene o'neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, i began to have a greater appreciation for this play. o'neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. while o'neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as eugene's own family never got a happy ending. i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. the audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. although i still believe ""long day's journey into night"" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill's exceptional writing.",0
"despite the fact that hanegraaff's name is the bigger of the two on the front cover, only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading, and they are the writing of paul maier.  his research is helpful, but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn't given a week-end to write it and come up with as much as he could.  every topic needs futher information.  a lot more could be said, and maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more.hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical jesus which is an even more surface-level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere.that said, i would give this book to someone who isn't much of a reader but for whom the da vinci code has raised some questions.  it isn't much more than a collection of scattered soundbites, but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction",1
"this book reads like a horror novel.by allowing her dogs (as well as another one in her care) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads, the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals' welfare.  not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors, and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps.oh, and let's not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author's choice not to spay and neuter her animals.this book moves at a peppy pace, and might have been interesting (albeit morally reprehensible) if the author's ""observations"" actually provided any insight.  but those eighteen-wheelers on the alewife parkway veered closer to poor misha than the author's whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence.  case in point:  she is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one's litter of puppies.  oops!any genuine dog lover (or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense) will despise this book.  a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head: if ""feelings"" are your road map to life, you might enjoy this book.  if you regularly take your brain out for walk, forget it.  calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling ""jonathan livingston seagull"" the definitive text on marine fowl",1

"mcmurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. it's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  if you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. i'd recommend  vollhardt and schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry)",1

"``people  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  are still occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  the greeks.  but  the people who say this don't understand why is has to be  so. it is because our language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  as long as there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we still have the adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible', as  long as we continue to talk of a river of time, of  an expanse of  space, etc., etc., people will keep stumbling over the  same puzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring at something which  no explanation seems capable of clearing up. and what's more, this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as people think they can  see `the limits of human  understanding', they believe of course that they  can see  beyond these.`` ''philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language````ambition is the death of  thought''' these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophy some 70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out). dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some 40 years, is one them. it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, john searle, studied under famous wittgensteinians (searle with john austin, dennett with gilbert ryle) but searle got the point and dennett did not. dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to ryle, whose famous book 'the concept of mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes wittgenstein, ryle(and many others since) have exposed in detail. by accident,just before this book, i had  read ''the minds i'', which dennett coauthored with douglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  two famous articles that pointed the way out of the mess---nagel's `what is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of john  searle's chinese room argument explaining why computers  don't think.   nagel pointed out that we do not even know how to recognize what a concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how it  differs from what a computer does(eg, it can translate chinese  without understanding it). likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what counts as good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave, cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and any discussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. unfortunately, he died in his prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  works and he never wrote any popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few. searle  is one of the world's leading philosophers and has written  many extremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in dennett's work. his review ``consciousness explained  away'' of dennetts 1991 book `'consciousness explained'' and his book ''the mystery of consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that is amazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophers and scientists who have written on this topic)have come close to explaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualize consciousness. many suspect we will never be able to conceptualize any of the really important things, but it is clear that we are  nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  searle with vituperative personal attacks. searle has been accused by dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  he just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   searle characterizes as ''intellectual pathology'', the views of dennett and all those who deny the existence of the very phenomena they set out to explain. dennett repeats his  mistakes here and leaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they are all mistaken and it is a waste of space to show how! unsurprisingly, there is not one reference to wittgenstein or searle in the entire book. there are however, many references to other old school philosophers who are as confused as he is. like most people, it does not cross his mind that the very inference engines he thinks with are forcing him to come to  certain conclusions and that these will often be quite  unconnected with or wrong about the way things are in the  world. they are a jumble of evolutionary curiosities which do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survival hundreds of thousands of years ago. wittgenstein was a pioneer in doing thought experiments in cognitive psychology and began to elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtleties of language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of comments that this review begins with. dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(which i hope we can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that ''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``consciousness  explained``. it is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein  from the opening quote: '' and what's more, this satisfies a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar as  people think they can see `the limits of  human understanding',  they believe of course that they can see beyond  these.`` the  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very, very  careful, some understanding is possible, but dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. there are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. there is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  he knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. by extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). however, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. the  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes. he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  if so, they will definitely win at least one nobel prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). so, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). and while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer. he starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, schrodinger's  dead/alive cat etc) and as feynmann said many times ``nobody understands physics!'' many think nobody ever will. on pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` this is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.on page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what's the problem?  one has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  what are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? i doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. this shows that there is something  strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. there are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'john will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  john might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, not being able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have.  one can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. this was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degenerating genetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequences except earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' let us alter wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''as long as there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink', as long as we continue to talk of  freedom of action, of saying i  wish i had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keep stumbling over the  same puzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring at something which  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up. ''as with most philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. on page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? even if i  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, i  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then  can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if i had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  the ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose. on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'it appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' and on page 13--''it is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. the whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. there is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does. on pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? the language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. we can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). the  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine having choices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is  saying this is the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. if we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away. . on page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention  here of wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of searle's now classic works  on intention and social reality. he spends much time on  ainslie's book 'breakdown of will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes.he makes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. it was bingham's idea, amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches  that are obligatory and promising. indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. on pg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. but where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. as he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the prisoner's dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious, they are much slower and  less reliable. so, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  if we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved. our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it.   we can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reason for the chaos in the world.on pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look like decision making(from certain angles)''. he claims that this plays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  the smoke is thick but i  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand as choice. he insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise. he  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and i doubt he could  do so. normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, i expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position. at this point he also starts his discussion of libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time. on page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  and ``illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` he says  the trick we need is to see that  ``i`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''the process of self description... is  what we  are''. the crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  he realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''i know that many  people find it hard to grasp this idea or take it seriously. it seems to them  to be a trick with mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisks consciousness, and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but i would  say it's incoherent and  that everything we know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long before we got this far. on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  this is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'darwin's dangerous idea''!  presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either).  though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.  we are also told here that r&d(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  i am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  he continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.  on pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. there is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.  he also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  we may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.  on pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. and on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.  on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  it's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'the blank slate'). he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess(evolutionarily stable strategy) can produce morality. his idea here is that genetic `r&d` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  i would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.  the last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart  and  honore, which i started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein.  dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  but, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. there is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. one rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  it seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines. so, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? it seems  clear(eg, see pinker's `the blank slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. on  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect. how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  and if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  to return to the quote at the beginning--'ambition is the death of thought'.  indeed--though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts",1
"the paper version is a real touchstone for the practice of all manner of applied mathematics.  the cd-rom version belongs in the discount bin.  here is why:1)  the cd-rom is edition 5; but edition 6 has been out for 4 years.2) the dynatext software, which is needed to read/browse/search the book, is showing signs of age.  it works fine on the computers of a decade ago but not necessarily on the machines of today.  see the review of j.f.groote.the product is advertised as working on macs but will not work on most macs.  specifically, it does not seem to work on either g4 or g5 hardware with os x, even under the so-called ""classic"" mode.  i believe that the problem is that the browser is shipped as an executable that requires a specific architecture.it is usable under windows, but you might need to use one of the backwards-compatibility options to run the installer.it will not apparently run under any form of linux, the most recent (and rapidly becoming the most popular) transmogrification of unix.  again, dynatext is put on the cd-rom as a binary executable; if you are not using sunos 4 or 5, solaris or sgi irix 5.2 then you can not use this product",0
"this book is unfortunately not up to par for kay hooper.  her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  the heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  if you like kay go ahead and read it, but i hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard",1
"i got this as both a book and an audio file.  i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., i gasped when he suggested christ went to hell...what bible passage evidences this?).i agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if i go further how much more eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  where were his editors when this was being written?  why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?i havent read all the reviews here but as one of those ""conservatives"" frequently mentioned in them i have to admit i may not even finish this book for fear of what else eldredge has slipped up on.i did appreciate his story about daniel and the ""delayed"" angel...but am left wondering if i need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.what a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  we are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the bible well.  so far...i may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize christians and return to the word itself.i wonder if i can get a refund",0

"this book really wasn't at all what i was expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. the subtitle, ""in search of grace o'malley and other legendary women of the sea,"" makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of grace o'malley, with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. not so. the first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself, and sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. i knew almost nothing about grace o'malley going into the book, and i know little more than that now. the other women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. she even talks about pippi longstocking! not what i was expecting at all...""the pirate queen"" is actually devoted far more to sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. i learned more about sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. she describes the inns she stayed at, the weather, the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of ""personal bath mats"" in northern european hotels... almost everything but grace o'malley and her cohorts. in fact, the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from wilson to sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, i really couldn't care less about. i bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. it turned out to be a travel memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that.this is a shame, really. sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - grace o'malley herself, bessie millie, janet forsyth, christian robertson, eliza fraser, isobel gunn, betty mouat, freydis eiriksdottir, skipper thuridur, trouser-beret, alfhild, the ""herring lassies,"" and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. she raises more questions than she answers, and i'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. you may also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned are northern european in origin. sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous pirates anne bonney and mary read who, though from europe, sailed the caribbean.as for sjoholm's writing style, the book is an easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. for example: ""the lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. in the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola"" (pg. 222). flowery, gratuitous, and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin, you might say... it's not the worst book i've ever read, but i do wish i'd spent my money on something else. it doesn't deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead",1

"i had heard of the importance, and significance of ""the education of henry adams"" for a long time. i finally determined i needed to read it.i acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first. i am sorry  i missed the greatness of this book. i am sure there was something wrong with me, but i found it to be incredibly unimpressive. perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man. he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house, and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there. granted, he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the white house. but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like adams depresses me. why did anyone bother? he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. the world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day. he was a very good historian in his time. but who reads his books now? not very many. in short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams.""the education of henry adams"" does not have much real information. he got education in one place, none in others. surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book. when eric sevareid wrote ""not so wild a dream,"" it was compared to ""the education of henry adams."" that was meant as a compliment. oddly, i think sevareid's book is much, much better. sevareid wrote of america, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. adams needed to get out more. he did not see america--not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid. i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams. again, a lot of this might be me. perhaps i read the book at a bad time. maybe i needed to read it a third time. i do not know. i do know i do not think this is a great american classic. forgive, please, my ignorance.",0

"if you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. and despite his &quot;official religious disclaimer&quot; at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. if you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading",1
"david fromkin's ""peace to end all peace"" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other.fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east (extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia) was created during and after the first world war. obviously, in order to do this, the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered.this is where fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the ""eastern question"" in their favour, the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process. admittedly, it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire (and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much.never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. the problem that fromkin has, however, is that he does not make these very well at all.the story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.additionally, fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. indeed, one map (showing enver pasha's advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia) is laughable in the extreme. the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not equilateral triagles.where fromkin does well, however, is in his use of purely european sources. it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east, but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question. in terms of europe, however, his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.ultimately, ""a peace to end all peace"" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this, and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been (the chapters in margaret attwood's ""the peacemakers"" or william cleveland's ""modern middle east"" both easily outshine this)",1
"surely i'm not the only one who found this book totally [bad].  the only thing it made me wonder about is how it's possible to write such a thorougly boring book about such fascinating women.  the writing is just dull and full of the author's biases and prejudices, which just aren't nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves.  it's written in that old-school feminism (negative, no fun) tone that thank god feminism has since moved beyond.  my advice:  find another book about women mystics not filtered through flinder's lens",0

"after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory, this sequel was an absolute let-down. the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie's (formerly wonka's) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth. while beyond the reaches of earth's atmosphere, our heroes---charlie, grandpa joe, and mr. wonka---must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids (pronounced ""k'nids""), aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes. far worse than these beasties, though, are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless. charlie, joe, and wonka, with no help from charlie's folks or other grandparents, save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory, where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills, returning them to infancy or beyond. charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites, who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters. at the end of the novel, the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president.in short, these three are the most tedious, spiteful, unredeemable characters i've come across in children's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book. as it is, they (unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last. their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore, rather than a joy, to read.",1

"the book is well-written.  most parts of it i can agree with.  but there is a crucial mistake in parson's message --- oneness likes to play separation.   i can say clearly that oneness does not play separation.  duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution.  saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion.  also, his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the ""mercy"" of something, and this is clearly very dualistic.  without ego, both doing and not doing are actions of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.  there are many illuminating sentenses in this book, but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap.  in my life, it was understanding, especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness.  the one who is doing the understanding is still oneness.  there is no duality in doing and not doing.  at right this moment, you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop.  of courses, you make choices in daily life.  if you really understand what is meant by ""nond-duality"", you will not make such statements such as ""there is no choice"".",1
"i respect the message of ""the unexpected legacy of divorce"" but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce ""unexpected.""  those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result.  staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times.  the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit.i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time.  they fell apart due to abuse, infidelity, and just plain incompatibility. what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents.  when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids, most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house.when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority, who constantly disappoints, hurts, and replaces the kids, there will be damage, no getting away from it.  however, is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids, seemingly with the other parent's approval?  i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion.it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married.  this is  a major flaw in  the research.  i didn't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference. i don't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens, you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears.  when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid's, whether it's divorce or starting a new life afterward, kids will suffer.i don't like 'studies' like this, they're misleading and potentially damaging.",0

"""the island of lost maps"" is the story of a petty crook named gilbert bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the '90s.  posing as a researcher, bland would enter rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single-edged razor.  then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers.  before being busted at the peabody library at johns hopkins university in baltimore, he had stolen more than a half million dollars' worth of maps.""island"" is the first book for author miles harvey.  in the book, he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page book.  he is only partly successful.  i found the material on bland's crime fascinating.  however, bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull.  unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text.  i found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime.  there is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking. but as a true crime book, it over extends itself.  it would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused",1

"this is a nearly verbatim rendition of the grimms' story, and it's hard to understand why zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children. even harder to figure out is how the american library association could award its caldecott medal for distinguished american picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale: the king threatens to kill the miller's daughter if she can't spin gold from straw. rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of spinning, a promise of her firstborn. she then marries the king, whom zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. when it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn, rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name. she sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name. so the king, though he looks good, is greedy and brutal. the queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized ""servant girl"" to save the child. and rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for. a weird, twisted story that offers nothing for kids, illustrated with renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad",0
"i'm really disappointed in this book, because the author seems to imply that you can have anything you want, but that is just not the case.  it's a deceptive title.  i can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you; you're better off practising feng shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book (and i'm not knocking feng shui, i practise it myself).  people like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense.  in the end, you'll just feel worse off, looking for the ""next big thing"" to promise you some more snake oil.another fact i'd like to point out is that this author sells this book in cd format for around $60.00 (i got a flyer in the mail).  if he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so-called ""secrets,"" doesn't that go against his own moral values?  one of the gimmicks of the cds is that you can learn the secret sound of ""creation,"" as if chanting ""ahhhh"" is going to make everything alright.  thanks to dyer and others like him, i am completely against any sort of ""positive thinking"" guru.  they are only after your money (while you keep wishing you had more).*btw, you might be interested to know that after reading this book, you're only going to find out that the big catch is that manifesting your destiny, according to the author, only applies to spiritual matters.  huh?  yes.  the entire book promises you can have anything you want, but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity.  the author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with ""god's"" plan, you don't have a chance either.  thought i'd mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated!",1

""you drive too fast!""  ""are you my mother?""  over and over and over.  the idea was good.  a modern-day frankenstein . . . or rather a frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, i know, frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  but you get what i'm saying.).  but the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  this book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly",1
"there are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.in this review we will concentrate on rima's(r)handling of the work of j m keynes.on p.84,r's claim that the physiocratic concept of hoarding is &quot;surprisingly suggestive&quot; of j m keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.on p.133,r claims that malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la keynes.what malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.nowhere does malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to ricardo.what malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with ricardo.in chapter 20 of r's book, she attempts to deal with keynes's theory of effective demand and keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled &quot;the employment function&quot;.r should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with keynes's chapter 20.r's figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts keynes's analysis",0
"to cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _left behind_ would take a whole book.  one hardly knows where to start.perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel.  as such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  god ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else.whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear?  who is the present-day equivalent of c. s. lewis, or catherine marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  these were writers who actually made you think.  lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  one wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.these days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  if _left behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind",1
"when i purchased this book i expected it would be life from a particular  bacteria's perspective.  by this i mean, &quot;well, today our host started  a new antibacterial therapy.  the last round of therapy was tough, but we  managed to make it through unscathed.  i'm confident we'll survive.&quot;   unfortunately, what i read was a scientific book written in non-scientific  language.  as a biology major in college and a medical student now, i've  read many scientific books written in scientific language.  so many that  they are pretty much all i can relate to anymore.  ha!  actually, that  statement has more truth in it than i care to admit, but i thought this  book would be a nice change of pace.  instead, it's a listing of  information about a certain bacterial species that i could have extracted  from bergey's.  the book is undramatic and uninteresting.  i wouldn't  recommend it to anyone",1
"i read this book with an open mind.  i am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status.  in a few cases, i think this criticism may be legitimate; in other cases, not.  so i was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the holocaust or their advocates in the jewish community.  (note:  i am not equating child abuse and the holocaust.  i am saying that when people speak up about terrible things, there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities.  all things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction.)i didn't find anything in this book to convince me of that.  what i found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the jewish reaction to the holocaust, in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over, and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons, but this discussion is so subjective and brief that i was not persuaded to adopt his point of view.  the bulk of the book consists of complaints that jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as switzerland.  the argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because i have never read the reports (""audits,"" etc.) to which the author refers.  but i think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point.  i expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the holocaust caused some jews to ""play the victim card,"" and what i got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which i have no way of determining the truth of the author's allegations.to me it seems obvious that the holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the jews, and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result.  it seems reasonable to me that the jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage, and to the extent that this book detracts from this, i think it is unfortunate",0

"i'm not a cosmologist, but stephen hawking's universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending.  the language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper.  moreover, the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense hubble knock-offs (despite being published in 1997), and the book has very little to do with stephen hawking.  sure, he wrote the foreward and did some editing, but it lacks the wit and wonder of a hawking work.  naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading.  i am a chemist, and despite this, filkin's descriptions of chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that aren't dumb-downable, and didn't include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts (like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration).  if you want to learn some cosmology, read &quot;a brief history of time&quot; or &quot;a short history of the universe&quot;.  these are simply written but informative works that won't leave you waiting for substance",1
"this collection of poems, tho representing a fine breadth of dickenson's works, is in final assessment a crime against the poet's great talent.  as is freely admitted in the introduction, the editor, mr. higginson, &quot;worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing the line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area.&quot;  this is a free admission of the book's guilt, having adulterated dickenson's original poems in both content and form.  gone are the nuances and passions that make dickenson one of the best american writers.  gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems' meanings.  and, worst of all, gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist.  as thomas h. johnson says in the introduction to &quot;the complete poems of emily dickenson,&quot; a representative mid-nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to estimate.&quot;  do yourself a favor and avoid this text.  instead, find one that is true to the original poems, one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author, and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of emily dickenson",1

"i picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands-on science activities     that are essential to good teaching and effective learning. unfortunately, i discovered on reading it that     the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific &quot;establishment&quot; with credulity for numerous     fringe ideas. the first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers     to tell when you'll be home for dinner! sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as &quot;evidence&quot;. the &quot;do     it yourself&quot; promise of the title is broken for the reader who doesn't intend to begin raising homing     pidgeons or doesn't happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants (such     as the speed of light) to nine significant figures. far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic     research are given (in chapters about the feeling of being stared at, or &quot;feeling&quot; the touch of a severed     limb). despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book, i liked a part of its message, that important science     can still be done by amateurs. that's about the only aspect of this book that is commendable",1

"on our beloved kay scarpetta and the illustrious ms. cornwell?  having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, i simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff?very slow in the beginning, i began to fear a repeat of the struggle that i endured to finish blowfly.  however, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  the storyline finds scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...richmond, virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  so scarpetta---with marino tagging along of course---heads back to richmond from her new home in florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of dr. joel marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  the demoralization of her former staff by dr. marcus is also unnerving to scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. so why has he asked her to come?meanwhile, lucy, as head of the last precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  for such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  in this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee.worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of african-americans throughout.  drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance cornwell references a dead young man's ""conspicuously large organ.""  are you kidding me?  the trash collectors are ""big dark men"" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the ""old black woman"" must work in one of the houses.  the author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as lucy.read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.dy",0

"gerd ludemann writes, ""historical research shows with definite clarity that jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax"", (190). a summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support.three streams of thought permeate ""the resurrection of christ"": gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish, invent, or explain away; peter and paul experienced hallucination and ""vision"" experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions, or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-christian polemic. in his chapter ""translation and analysis of the early christian texts on the resurrection"", ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles ""purpose and tradition reworked"" (re. gospel writers), and ""historical elements"". in the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic, or perhaps (he intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. for example, ludemann asserts that we may conclude that joseph of arimathea was a member of the jewish council (which condemned jesus), but that mark (earliest gospel) ""likely"" invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of god and had become a disciple of jesus. but ludemann needs to discredit such notions, for all four gospel writers record joseph as the rich council member that buried jesus in his own tomb. ludemann's case will be much weaker if jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances. ludemann gets carried away with himself when he, in tabloid fashion, suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to ""disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial"" of jesus. this is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze. ludemann goes so far as to accuse matthew, mark and luke of being anti-jewish! (refer to the ridiculous appendix 3).is christianity a ""history of self deception""? ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination; for the burden is on ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of jesus available in the new testament. that any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid. ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence. 1 corinthians 15 is the new testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of jesus' multiple appearances. even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's ad. the discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection, three physical events. also, the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of jesus eating and offering his body for examination, as well as being hugged! ludemann though, convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above, and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions, introduces hallucination. what accounts for these hallucinations? ""peter's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning"" (165). paul's ""event had a character of light and, like the vision of john, happened in the spirit, i.e., in ecstasy"" (47). but paul does not report ""i was in the spirit"" as john does (see revelation 1). john is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience. paul is not. when paul does have opportunity to convey an actual ""in the spirit"" experience, he does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 corinthians 12:2). so we have record of paul's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual. ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages ""modern depth psychology"" to explain paul's conversion from zealous persecutor of christians to ""apostle-in-chief of a new program of salvation"" (170-171). so, we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of paul's subconscious state, than from the widely accepted facts of jesus death, burial, empty tomb and appearances! ludemann's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural. historians look for the best explanation of the evidence. yet ludemann writes, ""who decides at what point of historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin"" (201). this is rife with misunderstanding. one need only confirm that an event occurred in history, regardless of theological implications.  also, simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an entirely logical proposition. yet ludemann quotes another author, ""[the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time."" (175). this ignores the new testament textual evidence that initially jesus' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened, and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works. even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle! ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with paul that if there is no resurrection, we should abandon christianity. sadly, he reaches the wrong conclusion. self deluded by a proliferation of ""one can imagine"", ""seems to indicate"", ""likely enough"", and ""one thus suspects"" reasoning, ludemann boasts ""accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer easter vision"". (210). may the reader decide otherwise",1
"murky: in his book, 1984, orwell described a contrived language he called ""newspeak"", designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible. but before orwell there were russell and whitehead, who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence. as whitehead wrote in his ""foreword"" to quine's ph.d. dissertation titled a system of logic: logic shapes metaphysical thought. thus in his ""on universals"" quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as ""entities"". and he co-authored with goodman ""steps toward a constructive nominalism"", a nominalist manifesto, in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or ""platonists"" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities. i believe that anyone who says that universals are ""referenced"" or who uses the phrase ""abstract entities"" fully deserves to be labeled a platonist. but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak. in the ""search inside this book"" screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting (p. 20) that realists say universals are shared ""entities"" and are ""referents"" of predicates. i ask loux: what happened to signification? the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense (i.e. signification) as well as denotation (i.e. reference) in the functional (i.e. predicate) calculus. i ask loux: what happened to supposition, which distinguishes reference from signification? in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions (i.e. significations) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization (i.e. reference), and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects. i ask loux: since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else? is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric? i see murky writing. muddled: loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine, the pragmatic realist, who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism, and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing. ontological relativity started as an analogy: quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time. einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton's absolute time, and he rejected lorentz's making relativistic time apparent time. likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory's positing of duality and indeterminacy. today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition, nonlocality and calabi-yau spaces in eleven dimensions. quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs. realism is a natural, primordial, irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories. on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial. it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history. it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories. but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity, and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity ""anti-realism"". in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism, but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change. i do not find this book contemporary. loux's ""realism - anti-realism"" locution is a false dichotomy. i see muddled thinking. marginalized: while a student i found notre dame's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism. when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking. i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students. readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site. thomas j. hicke",0
"i wanted to like this book...  i enjoyed the first two in the series.  but this one left me a bit dry...  babylon rising: the europa conspiracy by tim lahaye and bob phillips.this continues the story of michael murphy, a college professor teaching biblical archaeology.  he is now heading off to iraq to follow a tip on the location of ""the handwriting on the wall"" from the days of daniel.  he's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area, and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life.  talon and the mysterious seven are trying to eliminate him, and there are a few attempts on his life.  mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on new york designed to throw america into an economic and national panic, as well as to prompt the un to move their headquarters to the ancient city of babylon.  murphy, for someone who's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean, finds himself in the middle of all this...as i said, i really wanted to like this book.  the murphy character is likeable, and i enjoyed the action.  but the plotline was spotty and over the top.  murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him (highly unlikely).  everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time (over the top).  the story attempted to be both a christian end times novel and a terrorist suspense novel, and they didn't do either one especially well.  murphy's growing infatuation with isis was rather repetitive with the ""she's so beautiful"" and ""could she be interested in me"" interludes.  and finally, none of the plotlines wrapped up.  you got to the end and thought ""so?""  fine if you're ready to read the next installment, but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one...part of me wants to be nice, give the book the benefit of the doubt, and rate it a ""3"".  but the authors are better than this, and i've come to expect more from someone who's been doing this for a long time...  if you're committed to the series, you'll want/have/need to read it, but just don't come in with your expectations very high..",1

"amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization, the corporation, look moral. only someone like al capone could sympathize with this group on the oregon. how can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the oregon. the us apparently is willing to finance the group, but the us also financed sadam, noriega, ... unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real american policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous americans). the characters are clich?, there is no suspense since everything goes as planned, and anyone in the crew can just about do anything, including being a successful rock band. it makes me look back on the dirk pitt books and wonder about dirk's morality",0
"i have yet to use an actual phrase from this guide, but... it is good for re-charging my batteries when i have to write a review and feel uninspired.  after reading through some ideas in this guide, i usually find i can then find my own words to say what i need to convey.  the fact that all the phrases are positive, i see as a good thing because i feel it's important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you're reviewing.  if there are challenges in the persons performance, the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period.  i would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing... rather than use the phrases in the book. the people we manage deserve more than ""copy/paste"" reviews.",1
"seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that james frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as billy crystal.  but then they can only put out the cotton-candy coney island fluff as '700 sundays' is.  granted, the book is based on crystal's highly-praised tony award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  but it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night kaddish.  yet in ripping a page out of billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  it probably went something like: ""hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 sundays with your pop?""""well, i'm not a writer per se.  i just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage.""""so here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have.""""it'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads.""""don't worry, bubby, i know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  here's their recipe: they'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.

"hugh farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play bridge.  his college-age daughter karen, her friend barbara, his lawyer son duke, his alcoholic wife grace, and house servant joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit.  everyone scrambles to safety inside hugh's modern bomb shelter.as the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend barbara, right in the shelter.  as if hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.when the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world.  at first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves.  somehow, hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with barbara.of all the apocalypse fiction, this book is the worst.  the protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest.  he's not even a ""love to hate"" person.the dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and barbara and hugh's constant prattlings of ""darling, dear, and beloved"" do not fit the characters.  neither does hugh's occasional spouting of words like ""shall"" and ""shan't"" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the ""n"" word.there is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of hugh's daughter and barbara's friend karen, cannibalism, castration (hugh cared more about his ""boys"" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.the entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story.  and if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.  i recommend avoiding this book.",0
"this was required reading for my british literature class. it's the only novel in the class that i struggled with and only struggled from boredom. it is entirely possible that i just do not understand the genius that is forster, but i did not enjoy this novel. a lover of forster or modernist writing might enjoy it more. it must be a classic for a reason.",0
"this book is very disappointing, as is most of gunaratna's work on islamist terrorism. it's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear, ie. bin laden and aq are everywhere, responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups (such as ji) are aq franchises - total bollocks. the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a ""scholar"" who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary",0
"i couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. it was dry. i didn't get the imagery - i know it's supposed to be a classic, and i really wanted to read the book, i did - but it was long and boring and i just don't get why it's so ""classicly popular"". sorry, but it's how i feel. now, that being said, i read a condensed version of it, and i discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as i can go, even with the condensed version - it was only ""a little bit"" interesting",1
"if you liked whyte's previous sophomoric efforts, you'll love this.  in addition to being the same dumb, hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler:  in no real way does the story get advanced.  arthur begins as a baby, and ends as a small boy.  there are adventures, but nothing important happens.  as usual, in whyte's books, the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil, and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters.  with all the (totally ahistorical) democratic rhetoric, merlin's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot.  anyone who would read this, i guess, has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who never grow or change, and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship.  so go for it.  but please, if you want something exciting that will also make you think, look at the really good arthurian efforts out there--gillian brandshaw, a.a. attanasio, or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few..",0

"this story should have and could have been really good. it presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. it is very sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. i will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but i really didn't get much out of it. i can only praise heinlein for including the ""intelligent conversation"" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn. the whole story is just very odd. do read it though. it's a title to read if you wish to be considered ""well read."" despite its faults, valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget atticus from ""to kill a mockingbird.""",1

"i have no personal experience with 12-step programs nor do i have dominant addictions (other than book and dvd buying!) but i am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people and their stories and regularly deals with smoking, over-eating and love addictions in particular. i was hoping for some new ideas to assist clients.this book takes a rational-emotive type approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for those wanting to look at that approach. i also found some of his reference to research of how people recover also quite useful but he seems to have quite a personal, and often over-generalised, attacking crusade against 12-step programs. some of his concerns about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can have with 12-step programs were valid and useful. similarly i welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people always defining themselves as an addict and powerless.however he has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the evils he sees in 12-step programs  - and in very derogatory judgmental language. he often even implies they are all deliberately manipulating and exploiting people. i got very uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone.there appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these movements (and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them and have recovered). i would have rather he had used his own rational methods rather than resort to such abusive  language. he could have suggested modified views and tools, and alternatives to consider. i can't imagine that he would lure anyone away from the 12-step programs he criticises by attacking everything they have been standing for. however a gentler exploration of limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may have opened up a welcomed middle ground",0
"flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn's political preferences.  characters, like rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the ""real world"" works.  meanwhile, flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  while there are grains of truth in his characters, flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  i was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  i'm still looking.",1
"mark twain once said that (and i paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. that is my experience with this book. for some reason, a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt. so i picked it up. what a slog! a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for lucie manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. an admittedly cool concept. maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe i don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe i couldn't relate, but a tale of two cities bored me to tears.",0
"a good friend of mine insisted i'd read this book, because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life. in the end i was very disappointed.  not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but michael crichton's whole attitude.  he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  how can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  i have no desire to read any more of his books",0
"i had to read this book for a political theory class in college.  after talking with several other members i was happy to find out that i do not have the reading skills of a third grader...benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with.  the book is also not organized well.  in order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes.  points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book.  benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued.  throughout much of the book benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of john rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights.  to be honest, i disagree with her views and admit that i might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if i agreed with her.  still, i do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically.  much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories.  in short, i do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure, or intellectual curiosity.  if you have to read the rights of others for a class, i extend my condolences.",1
"children love to follow instructions, step by step, and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep, drag on for hours. any adult, who cooks like this doesn't cook often, cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen.for example, who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter, melts it in a pan then pours it into a (plastic, microwave safe) mixing bowl? great, now there's a pan, a knife and a cutting board to wash! it is a children's cookbook, so why not cut down on time spent with knives, stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave?  nice pictures, large font, recipes are great, but (in my opinion) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen, not a home.",1
"i have written software for development projects for 30 years and i have managed several projects. martin fowler has extraordinary insight, and i enjoy reading his papers for the gems of thought i find. the main lesson i pick up from this book is: break your large project into projects sufficiently small that you can sensibly abandon refactoring for each of the small projects.refactoring works well in some cases, i suppose. refactoring works well for some people, i suppose. i'm skeptical, though. fowler filled the book with page after page of the detailed refactoring method applied to a problem he acknowledged as too simple for application of refactoring. he assures us that refactoring may overload small projects with methodology, making it unsuitable for them, and it works really well for larger projects. i suspect, however, that the burden it imposes enlarges as the job enlarges. fowler gives me no good reason to think otherwise. if i'm to risk this methodology on a large project, i want to see it perform well on a smaller project first.fowler conceives methodologies that attract zealous disciples. in the case of refactoring, the methodology may succeed for its attractiveness rather than for its practical utility",1

"i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years. i was born & raised in the north. i think evans should rename his book ""fiddler on the roof in the south"". his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here. it's very much: the southern jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were accepted, etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'yankee jews', like the instances when a few (yankee)rabbis in the south fought for civil rights. evans should realize that times have really changed here! the evangelical christians in my town (which is most people here) harrass me like crazy - 'i am praying for you!' 'have you read the words of jesus, who was a jew like you?' 'when will you come to my church'. blah, blah, blah. thank god for the minority of catholics, methodists, presbyterians and a few others who live here. they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am, and the way i will stay - a jew. i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience. jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences, and that they cannot relate to what i am saying.but i do want to ask evans a few questions:1) if things are so great for the jews in the south: why have you lived in new york for decades now???2) why don't you at least write either a new forward to the book, a magazine article, etc., contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time (for some of us at least), primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians?i read evans' books before i moved here, and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here. for a jew who really cares about her/his religion living here is depressing; it is practically jew-less; and, at best, the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me. (by the way, i am planning to move to a city!)by the way, don't bother writing to me to tell me that i am ""wrong"", or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church. believe me, with all the praying for me that is going on in this town, and all the myriad attempts to convert me, if it hasn't happened by now, as they say in these parts, it just ain't gonna happen",1

"this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u.s. administrations. in that sense, it is the story of two cities - miami and washington - and two peoples - americans and cubans.  i have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup. the author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. it is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.",0

"this book was a huge disappointment. sue grafton and kinsey meander all over california but come up with nothing of substance. the author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. the characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. for example, kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. it doesn't work because it isn't real. it is sue grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. the story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. when it was all over, i still didn't know why the murders had been committed. save your eyesight! do not bother picking up this book",0
"i was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. this is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.i usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  she told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which i took to mean just a passing reference, but when i read the book, it was treated more seriously than i thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.it is inexcusable, both on ms pierce's part and on scholastic's.  no matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. i believe that as a parent, i'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so i can make an informed decision.anise hollingshea",1
"i had never read a danielle steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. i was pretty disappointed. i agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, i would still like it. i think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. yes, i get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! in addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, ""so and so was a devoted mother"" and repeating this fact again and again and again. these flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. this book did not leave me wanting to read more of ms. steel's books. it is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading.",1
the only redeeming points of this book are the few conversations that the author has with his uncle. the rest is just quotations from other books. there is enough original material here for about a chapter and a half. the author was set on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that other authors had said. i read it to the end though. probably because the author has a very nice writing style. he is probably a good playwrite though i have never read any of his plays. he just didn't have enough material for a book here. i'm surpised it got published,1

"i know that as a wolf-lover i am a bit biased, but i would still like to say that this book is stupid and incorrect.  you see, in this story, three children are left alone.  a wolf disguised as their grandmother tricks them into letting him in, because he wants to eat them.unfortunately, that's where this seemingly charming book starts going downhill.  this is just another stupid book that, summed up, says ""wolves are evil, ugly beasts who attack people!!  we have to kill them all before they gorge themselves on our children!""yep, the wolf is depicted as evil in this book.  why couldn't they make it something that actually hurts people, like a bear or a mountain lion?  ignorance, that's why.  the wolf is also depicted as stupid and easy to trick in this book.see, near the end, the children try to trick the wolf by telling him he can become immortal by eating gingko nuts.  they plan on luring him into their trap, to get rid of him.  the wolf instantly falls for it, which is lame.  wolves are among the most intelligent and perceptive animals on earth!it's practically traditional to make children's books with wolves as villains, and the chinese seem to loath wolves, but this book crosses the line.don't let your kids read it unless you want them to think wolves are savage, stupid, man-eating beasts.  if they already think so, you'd be neglecting mankind's need to know things even more by letting them read it.in other words, it's a terrible book.",0
"i couldn't read past the second chapter.  roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims.  it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of ""the bitter"".

"i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years.  however, this book is misleading and dangerous.  almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).  writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - mr. crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of ""references"" to support this premise.  tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.  i hope that someday mr. crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  there is a quote: ""with great power comes great responsibility.""  but in this case it would seem: ""with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet.",1

"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, ""then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.""  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.",1

"having read detective comics #471-479 in the 70s done by this same creative team, i picked this up, hoping for more of the same. what a let-down! i have to ask - what happened!?the art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest, most detailed art i'd ever seen in a comic-book. i think that was due mostly to the inking of terry austin. when he was working on x-men, he gave john bryne's pencils that fine detail as well.has austin done a 'gil kane' and given up his nib-and-ink to work with marker-pen? this dark detective series shows none of the fine-ness of his previous work. you only have to compare the 'flash-backs' of this series to the original detective comics issues to see that something is wrong.maybe austin or rogers are getting older, but the artwork is very basic, and lacks the sheen they used to produce. the art sometimes actually reminded me of bob kane's early work.the story also is a little unbelievable. it portrays bruce as a love-sick puppy and just doesn't ring true. also, the lettering is - well, it's been hand-done, by rogers i surmise, and is quite uneven. it should have been done by computer.i'm sorry - i so wanted to like this, but it's nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s.",1
"this book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or european or is overly valued in american history textbooks.  loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  ""lies my teacher told me"" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic sociology professor.  the only reason i didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased",0
"reviewer alianore's opinion ""rather too indulgent of its subject"" is a very accurate portrayal of weir's work. i will try to add something to that near perfect review. (note: i listened to the unabridged audiobook of ""queen isabella"", 22 hrs on 18 cds).the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. the last third is the worst: weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of queen isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed just queen of england.this book is really ""subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization"". i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. it is rhetoric because of the endless ""weasel words"" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: ""some say"", ""it has been said"", ""many believe"", ""therefore we may assume"", ""it can be inferred"" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. these expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons.equally irksome is weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. she is always 'declaring' for us the contents of isabella's thoughts. remarkable gift she has for this. many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. but then moments later she will portray isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. this isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda.i don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris' ""rise of theodore roosevelt"" and ""theodore rex"". i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. yuck. really.)if prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. and much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. the only way i could enjoy ""isabella"" by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with ""several pounds of salt"" as the above referenced reviewer advises.2.5/5",1
"being an engineer in the aerospace industry i was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a ""hard industry."" i personally believe that it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth, not legal services or newswires. so this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation, give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is, and suggest ways to improve it. oh, how very, very wrong i was . . .  this book started off strong, . . . for about four pages. after that a litany of tortured logic, un-sourced assertions, facts taken completely out of context except for the author's subjectively added adjectives, orwellian double-speak, sleight of hand arguments, flat out ridiculuos statements, contradictory assessments, and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left george soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century. even a broken watch is correct twice a day though, so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating. these include: - manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry, creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs, provided it's run right. (a big if.) - high wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive. - americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates. - there is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view, leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain. (i.e. enron)  a scholarly, fair, and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful. this is not what you'll get in this book though. instead you'll get:a begining section about postindustrialism, things like the internet, information technology, financial services, etc., the things that make the services based economy. in three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates, instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument. not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men, set them on fire, and piss on the smoldering remains. this is where vitriol even comes out, where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking. if someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument, they probably don't have one. most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist. to me, this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to, oh, i don't know, let's say a fish.a middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing. this is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large. this is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data, charts of gdp growth over time, pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services, manufacture, agriculture, etc. you will get none of that. there's little value except in reassuring the obvious, high wage nations can do manufacturing. many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still don't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though! you also know you're being left in the dark with a plethora of cya disclaimer statments like ""while industry_x has certainly had its share of problems recently . . ."" at the begining of a section.   a final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire, free markets, and the concept of free trade. george soros and a bunch of other lefties, with pat buchanan thrown in for ""balance"", should be listened to instead. the worst part of this book is the author's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument. examples of twisted thinking abound:- a post-industrial ""industry"" grows five times over in a certain period. the author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad. later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60%! self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise. the author's challenge to the reader seems to be ""who are you going to believe? me, or your lying eyes?"" - he rips into american post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world. later he talks about how great german manufacturing is because germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world's workers. - the only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context. when describing service industries ""paltry"" $50 million revenues, ""only"" 60,000 jobs, ""disappointing"" 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common. but when describing manufacturing ""a very high"" $6 million revenues, ""a good mix"" of 1,500 jobs, and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow. a number in and of itself means nothing. the fact the author leaves out any head on, direct comparison between industries is telling. - official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes. when the official figures don't agree with him, he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong. when attacking his straw men though, he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner.  - gems of orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like ""solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity. (pg. 184)"" i.e. it's competitive where there is no competition! and ""even in singapore, one of the freest societies in the east, the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . (pg. 229)"" that's not very free if it's forced is it? (his defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages i've ever read and really is worth the price of the book. he capstones it with the ""most encouraging"" observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make!- to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out. wow, what an achievement. any actual power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it's internal workings wear out, but whatever . . .)- americans are dumb and the only successful american companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards. the american economy, despite the statistics, is in bad shape. the japanese instead are eight feet tall, can read people's minds and see through lead. the japanese economy, despite the statistics, is in really great shape. this type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims, and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments. the author basically can't get out of his own way.  - he always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don't put numbers into context, are using twisted logic, making mere assertions instead of quoting facts, etc., apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses!- he claims boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's. this is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper. america isn't doing that badly in aerospace by the way. the author fails to mention that 50% of the ""european"" airbus is made in america. this is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient. the list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions. you'd have to buy the book to see them all because there's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page. all in all, this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity. it's really a mercantilist argument, and the only common thread that i could see in all the author's cloudy reasoning is that nation's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what. it's not, unfortunately, a book about how to revitalize american manufacturing in a globalized world.",1

"casual book browsers who stumble across braden's book, ""the isaiah effect,"" might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title: that there exists some mystical, unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques, research, and understanding. i, as one such browser, had briefly read about the so-called ""bible code"" which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related. with my interest piqued at the title and the book description, i delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed isaiah's ""precise instructions"" of prayer. i wanted to know exactly what braden claimed to have stumbled upon.what i found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new-thought concepts. the mixing of religions, for example - a sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled over and over again, drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books. in only one chapter does braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of isaiah. instead he relegates the books of the essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence.in the brief pages in which braden actually does discuss isaiah, his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science. his basic premise of ""the effect"" is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present. such a revelation is not a new interpretation of isaiah at all. any student of the bible and christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the old testament are records of god warning israel, and the world, of turning away from him.to braden's credit, his discussions of the effects of prayer in today's society are commemorable, albeit somewhat misguided. i agree with him that people in today's society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they've surrounded themselves. however, i believe braden over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer. he fails to discuss how humans, and their emotions, are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes.braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts. in the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created. humbleness before god and the filling of the holy spirit are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human feelings.a disappointing read",1
"i must say i enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that i was disappointed.  i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. all we had at the ending was ashes. also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. the book is worth reading, but i wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, du maurier had written a better ending.",1

"ageless body is deepak's attempt to neutralize the word ""old"" as in old age.  the writer has a knack for making common words, like ""body, ""mind"" and ""self,"" into profound concepts.  his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.	if you like poetry, deepak may be your read: ""the billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (p. 36)""  or try to interpret this one: ""the emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (p.40)"" 	at times he attributes to cells and dna a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  he would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over ""intelligent design.""  he can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  he mentions and attacks evolution only one time on p. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.	deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  whether your word game tosses in the word ""quantum"" or not doesn't change much.  what a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  i wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane",1

"i'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  i don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  is there really such a thing as &quot;national character&quot;? people are  just too different, too unpredictable. how well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  how well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  would every italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as mr. barzini ?  i seriously doubt  it.  so what we have in the italians is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million italians.  after reading it, i felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  an  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the &quot;inside view&quot;--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  while barzini is  indisputable italian, he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   this is not a successful gambit.  cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; sicily  and the mafia; and last, the tragedy of italy's long domination by  foreigners.  but nothing really connects.  there are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  the reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history.   these sections were well-written and interesting.  but his portrayal of  italian &quot;character&quot; is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  myself, i  got pretty tired of those lists.  if you want to know something useful  about italy, read another book.  if you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about italians, then this book could  be for you",1
"the author has her narrator(""cinnamon"") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, scarlett still comes out miles ahead. perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as ""ivanhoe"" presents.the story may have been one-sided,but it's the side mm chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the ""myth"" of the old south,as in all myths. margaret mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called ""parody"",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-katie scarlett o'hara and the wonderful melanie wilkes.as if rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with scarlett.that's why he turned to women like belle watling.and to imagine mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to ellen o'hara from ellen's childhood.thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic gwtw,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.gwtw will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.i didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and i read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.i'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.ludicrous and laughable-try again,ms randall,and try to get over the jealousy of scarlett and co. again,margaret mitchell need not fear,lol",1

"i am not going to repeat other reviewers discussion of the lack of character development.my issue is with the lack of basic research.  one incident has hawke's zodiac being fired upon by a french patrol boat's missile.  bell uses the harpoon missile as the weapon.  the french have their own very effective ship to ship missile in the exocet.  very unlikely that the french would use an american made harpoon.  later in the novel, hawke is taking off from a carrier deck in the latest vtol aircraft, the f-35.  the catapult fails and hawke is put in grave danger.  my problem, this is a vtol aircraft, which the author goes to great lengths to mention and describe.    why would there be a ""cat shot"" at all.  vtols are designed for vertical takeoff and then transistion into level flight, which, again the author describes.  also this scene has nothing to do with the story.  just another ""saturday cliff hanger"" episode.this is my second attempt at a ted bell novel, assasin being the first.  there are too many other writers out there than give a sense of believability for me to waste my time on this type of thriller.  i believe the author has the ability to create a very good novel.  i wish he would cast aside the unbelievable and go with something a little more creditable",1
"the literature of september 11 is never attacked.  when a book speaks of september 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  jonathan safran foer's extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  the narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from guenther grass's die blechtrommel), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include hiroshima / nagasaki, the staten island ferry crash, and the dresden bombings.  each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical ""trauma"" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, thomas schell, jr., a victim of september 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are ""reading""---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (thomas shell, sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  who has done the editing?  almost certainly an older version of his grandson oskar).  if the term, ""reading"" even applies.  whenever a ""pregnant"" image is described, foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  when a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  space is not used in the manner it is in the works of edmond jabes, for instance.  typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  as far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases (""heavy boots,"" ""raison d'etre,"" etc.) and sunday school platitudes: ""sometimes one simply wants to disappear"" (184); ""there's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself"" (184); ""everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers"" (245); ""how can you say i love you to someone you love?...  it's always necessary"" (314).  whenever the author writes something that he finds ""beautiful"" and ""true"" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is ""beautiful"" and ""true.""  the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that foer also communicates in his essay, ""emptiness"" (originally published in playboy) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (ringo star) and scientists (stephen hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.joseph suglia, ph.d., the author of watch out",0
"i was really looking forward to reading ""ever after"" when i saw the favorable quote on the back cover by  larry gelbart. but the book turned out to be a very cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight. here are the three things i learned from this book: (1) mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) andrew lloyd webber is the anti-christ; (3) the only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started off-broadway (mostly at playwrights horizons and lincoln center). most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each, with very few illuminating details. here's what the author says about ""carrie,"" perhaps the most famous recent broadway musical flop: ""carrie, of course, was an instant classic, a monument in the pantheon of failed broadway musicals. adapated by michael gore (music) and don pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious stephen king novel (and even more notorious film), this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the virginia theater on the 12th of may, 1988 and was gone by the 15th, touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible, monumental ineptitude."" does that really tell us very much about this musical? did barry singer even see the show? you sure wouldn't know it from this description. and just what, i wonder, makes king's novel ""notorious"" or the movie ""even more notorious""? almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention, but somehow singer finds time for an entire chapter of lloyd webber-bashing where sir andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery. the chapter sticks out like a sore thumb, if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book, but also because it's one of the few times that singer goes into any detail. aside from a few interesting sondheim quotes, this book is a waste of time.",0
"updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development.as other have stated, you know from page one that the final page will involve an arab, a truck and a bomb.  the lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps excellent writing, interesting character development or original insights.  updike fails to deliver on all three counts.one particularly slipshod literary technique updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character ahmad.  when ahmad speaks, it is in the voice of an intelligent, thoughtful foreigner.  his phrasing captures very well the cadence, vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non-native speaker of english.  curiously, ahmad is an american, raised in new jersey by a thoroughly american mother.  so, what influences created this stilted phrasing?  updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a jersey teenager speaks like a pakistani or egyptian immigrant.  there is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character's life is grating.updike also relies heavily on ethnic/religious stereotypes.  sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature.  however, in updike's case, the stereotypes make little sense at all.  for instance, a high school counselor's entire personality is attributed to his ""jewishness"" both by himself and by others who opine on his personality.  this is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a jew and, in fact, his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier.  so where does all the jewsih influence come from?  likewise, ahmad's mother's personality is often linked to her irish heritage.  yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her irish background (which could have been many generations ago) has influenced her one bit.  the reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless character development.another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the korna in arabic.  obviously, few western readers will understand arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages.  what comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research.  if that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in western script rather than arabic script.  after all, the koran is not written with western phonetics in mind.ultimately, the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight, poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author",1
"sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author. when the author is in error about that subject, the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions in the rest of the book. such is the case here.i've written 123 books; several on parachutes and skydiving. i am a pilot, skydiver and parachute rigger; i know the sport and the industry. the author wrote:""we use flat chutes as parasails."" what is ""flat""? square? rectangular? ram-air?a ""parasail"" is a kite and is usually under tow behind a boat. this sentence does not make any sense.""four miles up, he pulled"". that would be 21,120 feet. the use of oxygen is not mentioned.""ferocious, out of control spiral. one of the cells collapsed."" the collapse of a single cell will not cause a fast turn and the cell is easily re-inflated.""corkscrewing caused the other cells to collapse."" not likely.""guide lines""an uncommon reference. they are referred to as control lines or toggles. he jettisoned the main canopy at 15,000 feet. he freefell ten seconds and opened his reserve at 12,700 feet. the rest of the team on this haho jump would still be at 18,000 feet.

"this book should get 0 stars; speaking as an artist myself, the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous. the basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics, etc. to me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master, and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse.admittedly, i could not even finish this book; after reading for the nth time a line of shaky, circumstantial evidence like ""all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw, but there are no correction marks, therefore optics must have been used,"" i could not even stand to keep reading! on the contrary, all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult, after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature, and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction.that is just one example... the book is filled with flaky examples such as those - hockney claiming ""this is too good to have been done without optics"" or ""this was too difficult to have been done without optics"" - and i found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art, if that is indeed what he thinks. and, modern artists must remember this: nowadays, the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists, for many reasons. superior art education is very hard to find, and there are many distractions in the modern world (tv, computers, having to hold a 'day job', lack of patrons, etc.) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did. therefore, most will never attain the skill of the old masters. but that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology!some of the other examples used as 'evidence' refer to 'odd' proportion, perspective, etc. in otherwise masterful work. i am surprised that this author (and those readers who are artists) apparently does not realize that throughout history, great artists did not necessarily strive for exact realism - even nowadays, photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists, because after all we are artists not cameras! the point of realist art is to accentuate the reality, not to copy it! therefore, many inconsistencies in proportion, perspective, etc. evident in old masters' work are not 'oddities' or 'mistakes', but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition. all that being said, i think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist, since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of 'trickery' or technology of some sort. instead, an art student should be encouraged to build skill, discipline, and self-reliance - because that is the true secret of the great masters",1

"yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put, but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write.my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.  comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be, acceptable to me.  occasional use can be overlooked, but shaara peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject.  the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading.the following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes:""he turned in the saddle, rode toward his headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead, forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand.""one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this.  the result is a book that reads like a rough draft, or maybe not even that;  it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft.  i don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and i don't understand why readers put up with it.another problem is the lack of convincing characterization.  everyone is vaguely noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads.  washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  i think you get the picture.  few characters stand out on their own.  even lafayette is just another young officer.  the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book.  and shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work.  the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull.beyond that, i'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter.  it's fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin's mind.  but the rest of the time, it doesn't work well.  i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus.  either i'm a lazy reader (and i'm not), or the device isn't working well.  in addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france, and washington, green, cornwallis and howe in america.  that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england, and the continental congress in america.  in effect, this novel is really about washington's military camp and howe's dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced.some aspects of the story are interesting.  i enjoy reading about washington's maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him.  i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.  but i wish now that i'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war.  most of the book, as literary fiction, left me cold",1
"this is a good book, but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book.einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory.for instance, e=mc^2 was not created by einstein, as so many people people. an italian physicist came up with it. if you don't believe me check any encyclopedia.einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. this was helpful to the world of physics.unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book. when it came out it was already outdated. this was published in the 60s. autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 i believe). if this was published in the 20s or even the 30s, it would have been a good book",1

"i don't know what to say about this book. it is the single worst book i have ever read in my young life.  i feel like i've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  i would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  this book is truly an offense to literacy, and i cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  i can only imagine that robin cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. i have read children's essays that have been better written.while it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are:-knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery-cliche mania with lines like, ""i going to get to the bottom of this mystery"" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives.-racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball.-stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny.-incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too)-wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy.-incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them)-the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. i got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it.if anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.",0
"i can't give this book more than two stars, and that's being generous. mr. hall does present some interesting ideas, but unfortunately, his editors have done him a huge disservice. here are the first three sentences of stage i, on page 23; essentially what we have now--nanoscale science and technology--including the ability to image at the atomic scale with scanning probe microscopes, and a very limited ability to manipulate, that is, by pushing things around with the same scanning probes. a scanning probe is essentially like feeling something with a stick. because you have a computer behind it, you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a picture.i made it through the first fifty pages, and it didn't get any better.  i don't know if mr. hall had a final read before publication, or not, but someone should have stopped this book from being published until it was properly edited.",1
"i'm a fan of dave barry, i enjoy his column, i enjoyed some of his books in the past, and i bought this one with great anticipation. boy was i disappointed! the story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.do yourself a favor, do not read this book! i can't believe anyone recommends it",1
"after anticipating the arrival of this book (that i ordered some time before publication after hearing of it), i was disappointed.  although the subject is timely, the writing style smacks of academia and therefore, will not appeal to the mainstream (reader).  because i'm tenacious by nature, i finished the book, but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention.  too bad - it could have been inspirational",0
"i've read and enjoyed all the starfist novels. this is one of them in name only. it starts like a typical starfist novel and even ties in some references to charlie bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends.i never did figure out what the author's point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash. the men of the fist are hard working, hard fighting marines who trace an honorable history back to the us marines of the 19th & 20th century. these ""force recon"" marines are a ruthless bunch of screw-ups who could trace their ancestry back to the waffen ss.rather than root for them i soon found myself rooting for the opposition. they invade a fellow member of the confederation, screw-up their primary assignment, fail to get the info they were sent for, kill allied soldiers and airmen, murder helpless civilian prisoners, and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state.someone should remind the authors that recon is about getting accurate, timely, information. it's not about blowing things up.i really wasted my money on this book, i definitely won't be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle.",0
"how can a best-selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? one answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon. simon and the raccoons; simon on the failing american economy; simon attempting to reproduce american accents. this is a cd set for avoiding",0
"if you like this book you will probably like ""bless the child"" by cathy cash spellman.  they are very similar.  this book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  what a contrived piece of garbage!i can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  if it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  if it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  if it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  that's how bad this book is! it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.this author has no style.  the book reads like an episode of inside edition.  there is no immersion into the story.  the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  as a reader i felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  i've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  do not waste your time.  i must say though that this novel was inspirational.  if this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published",1

"the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well.  the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation.  why could the equation not be solved?  there is a reason for this fact, and the mathematical theory explains it well--but not this book.  perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general.  the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book; but apparently not in this one",0
"i will not try to say that i asserted the painstaking, analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of heidegger. more than that, i have no interest in doing so. it is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being (existence), and my reading didn't lead me to any other conclusions. so as i said i have no interest in reading this a second time, further, deeper, or slower.being and time is chock full of invented terminology, to the extent that michael inwood was able to profit from his publication of a heidegger dictionary. whatever you might think the word ""world"" means, for instance, is not what heidegger means, and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so. this is the case with his entire vocabulary. if there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by heidegger, i would not bring this up as a crticism.beyond the unventilated, severely sober, and utterly uninspiring character of being in time, i also call attention to the futility of it's project. if heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being, perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him: that there is no question of being. why is ""the question of being"" so problematic? because it is unanswerable, maybe. or if it is answerable, we're not in any position to answer it. ""being"" implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn't make sense. and if you posit an idea that is so concrete, so constant, you can't just bend it to make it fit reality. you've already betrayed your questioning. truth, including the truth of being, is a local phenomenon. truth is not always and forever true - it's true when it's true. but heidegger wanted an everlasting truth, a dogmatic anthropology.worse than the general uselessness of his project, and the toxic dregs left in his wake, heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thought-provoking way",0
i bought bead fantasies and bead fantasies ii at the same time after reading the positive reviews; i wish i had looked at these books before buying. there are pretty motifs that i will incorporate into my beading projects but i find the small typed directions overly simplistic and the diagrams are too small. i'm glad this isn't my first beading book or i would feel totally discouraged from trying any of these projects. i won't be buying bead fantasies iii.  the art and elegance of beadweaving and coraling technique remain my favorite beading books.,1
"i bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a row w/our preschooler and i don't much like it. i've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if i need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality. in the end, i think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. i just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'i own you'. i like 'mama do you love me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.'good-night moon' by margaret wise brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. they love it and so do we as parents. but this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family.take it w/a grain of salt",1

"let me get myself straigh here first. i have always been a fan of the artemis fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. i loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of ""evil"" foe. also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. they were high tech and armed with laser guns. unfortunately the author put artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.now let me rewiew this particular book. its a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts?no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a ""barbie"" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. how old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. i always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. i read colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.all of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. do not even read this thing. get some other artemis fowl books, or read alex rider,. thats a very good read.",0
"i generally like elmore leonard, this is the twelfth book of his i've read, ranging from his detroit crime capers, to his l.a.-set chili palmer stuff, to some of his westerns. other than the terrible ""be cool"", this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934, the story follows carlos ""carl"" webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot u.s. marshall. the story takes place in the dusty midwest, mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city, as carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.carl is a somewhat vain, cocky lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl's path. mixed into this are kinds of period details, from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to ""true detective"" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers pretty boy floyd, john dillinger, and bonnie and clyde barrow. despite all this background detail, the story itself failed to engage me. there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard's best work. there's a good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. in fact, about halfway through the book i realized that the ""real story"" wasn't going to kick in -- i was in it! and unlike many leonard books, the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. even leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. ultimately, one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. that said, the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time and place. all in all, unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing, not worth the time.",1

"while it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone",0
"i think in retrospect i wasted my time on this one. it had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me. as i read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery, i kept on hoping that there would be something more to it, something more enigmatic, a brilliant twist but i was left with despair. my major problem with this novel was there were not enough, in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer. and bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities. i will never touch this author's book again! a mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best-dan brown",1
"the author had a great idea, but he cherry-picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense. for example, superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2. two jewish guys, right at the end of ww2, write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b/c it's destroyed... etc, etc.i'm not critiscizing this book b/c it has a religious message. i'm critiscizing it b/c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement. otherwise, i disagree with anybody that says it is ""just a comic."" superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america",1
"this book was so badly written that i just couldn't help writing my first review on amazon. i never bothered writting reviews.while i fully respect the authors' decision in providing the book online under the creative commons license, and while i do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions, the book is a total f*ck up. and f*ck up is an understatement.the book:1) is unorganized :-i felt i was being bombarded by information from all directions. one moment i was getting ready to test a simple ""hello world"" module, and the other i'm suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing ""how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel."" with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter. how the hell did i get here? it just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated.2) is upside-down:-i read chapter 3 (char drivers) and i compare it to real device drivers and some things just don't match. the book seems very theoretical because the ""real"" device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all. after digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet i realize that in the ""real world"" there is a whole driver-model and generic objects and what not. reading the source code documentation and some online material i actually understand how the ""real"" drivers work. i still don't understand the stuff in the book. i start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver-model  and i find it in chapter 14 !!!!!!! the driver model seems, in my opinion, the first step to understanding how ""real"" drivers work and i find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce!! not only that, the authors decide that ""many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely"" and ""the complexity of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with a high-level view""... surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book!3) is sadistic:-one thing i really hated was the carrot-and-stick approach the authors chose. first they give you a small tiny taste of a topic   which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you're about to reach somewhere, they do a complete u-turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off-the-topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better. you end up confused, annoyed, and duped. like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the ""hello world"" module. ok fine. seems easy enough. you naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself. haha wroong! the book suddenly does a ""make hello.c"" without showing you the content of the makefile. it leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable-""hello.c"" and goes on describing in detail seemingly random stuff. you are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter ""as-is"". i chose the former. hahaha wroong agaaiin! i ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later.(at least they mentioned it?!)in summary.. i'd suggest you buy the book.. and (as ""./documentation/managementstyle"" for another book says): ""not read it. burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture"".i don't think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book. if you come across any online material that ""recommends"" this book, *quickly* discard that material too .. without thinking.this is a -5 stars book. it has affected me personally",0

"i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one-sided book i've ever read.  it wasn't about the crimes, it was about this author's personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos.  he has a real problem with women, lesbians in particular.  he made ms. wuornos out to be someone she wasn't.  she had a hard life, yes and chose to committ crimes, but that wasn't what this book was about.  again, it wasn't worth the $.  i actually threw my copy of this away",0
"let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy.  after reading this book, i now think he is one step above slime. to be fair, some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing.he is anti-pc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie o'donnell, michael moore, barney frank, barbara streisand, and ""that fat girl from the dixie chicks"", among others.  no problem there in my opinion. that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book.the rest is just babble, often repeated over and over again, that even larry lovers will find annoying.  a couple things that really bothered me.  the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of ""retards"" and down's syndrome children.  he must use the term ""retard"" at least fifty+ times in the book.  this is appreciably different than making a joke about, say, michael moore.  moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes.  the down's syndrome children did not. my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on ""retards"".  he also racially sterotypes in the book.  many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond.  the down's syndrome kids can't.  larry, i can only hope god (in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book) grants you a ""retard"" child to love and care for.  then, i would like to read your next book. i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly.the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses.  he plays the good 'ol bubba. he ain't too bright and he ain't ever changed since he left the farm.  his ""celebrity"" - his word not mine - has not gone to his head. ok, larry. why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures, including serious topics such as abortion?  why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down?  why the unrelenting references to your ""celebrity""?  the terms ""meet and greet"" and ""after-party"" were used over and over and over, as an example.  do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are?  well, you are wrong.  they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become.  that's hollywood-speak my country, fart loving, nose picking friend.overall, this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron (see doesn't that sound better than ""retard"").  my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people.  those who are dumb and know they are dumb.  and those who are dumb but are so dumb, they don't realize it.  the former category usually shuts up (knowing they are dumb).  the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter. the first group is obviously smarter than the second.larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group.  the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book. make jokes, larry, and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like.unfortunately, larry can't see the obvious.  like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book, he has become exactly one of them.  a thin layer of ""good 'ol boy"" on top, covering a core of venom and ""celebrity"". he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets.my suggestion: don't buy larry's act and, by all means, don't buy the book.",1

"honestly, i thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  the author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  also, the particular print of the book that i purchased, has a dog on the cover, i was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  instead, i felt i little duped. most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of ""my friend's dog fido, one day did this...""  i hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  i mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  i suspect that i, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author. i don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  now, if your ""thing"" is cows....  get this book!",1
"now, i enjoy victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average ""next person"" hasn't ever read any. tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. what's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. on the surface of it, haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) ""king solomon's mines"" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.however, despite this promising laundry list, haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. a friend described it rather aptly as ""a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot."" which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. there is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the ""lost city"", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.i suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the gazette. as i understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. in any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all i'm likely to recall from this book in a year. of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of ""she-who-must-not-be-named"", from several earlier adventure novels by edward bulwer-lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. i suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of victorian englishmen: racism, anti-semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark.",1

"thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  we like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.john grisham cheats us out of that fun.  the villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  that's bad.read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules",1

"alright, so her childhood was a bit different than your average white middle-income childhood. should this motivate anybody to write a completely non-imaginative, devoid of any insights book? don't be fooled by the exotic side of it. a poor writer can ruin a story, regardless of the exotic locale. if you were expecting to find an ""international"" jewel like jhumpa lahiri's ""the namesake"" or zadie smith's ""on beauty"", you will be greatly disappointed. if you are into africa, read something that has more than the exotic place to say for itself. ben okri's ""the famished road""  (booker prize winner) or the palm-wine drinkard and my life in the bush of ghosts (paperback) by amos tutuola  will be much better choices.",1
"i'm on page 110 of this book. the book has 220 pages. i'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person i am angry with. i bought this book because i have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. but, it is having the opposite affect. i feel i was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). part 1 tells us what a ""grievance"" is. it tells us, and tells us again, and again, and again. the thing is  i already know what a grievance is! i know i'm angry at someone, and i know it's not healthy, i know to forgive would help me.... i didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. all that reading did was make me dwell and think more about the problem and increased my anger because of the book itself. when i reached ""part 2"", entitles ""forgiveness"" i thought finally.... but all part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. there are some great reviews of this book here at amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. but so far i can't agree with any of the positive comments. i have a great degree of respect for stanford university, i went to high school across the street from stanford and have taken classes there, but it pains me to have such a great school's name attached to this book. is it fair of me to write a review of a book i have not finished? no... but i'm afraid to continue reading it. i'm already angry and to buy a book that i thought would help me, only to find it frustrating me, i don't feel is not all that fair either......",1
"""the other boleyn girl"" and ""the queen's fool"" are two of the best books i've ever read--and i've read a lot of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. they were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out, i buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. ""the virgin's lover"" fell flat, and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. anthony trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. that may or may not be the case with gregory. i know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. so to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. they feel forced, constructed. i'm going back to trollope",1
"the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  i was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  i mean graceland for a first date?  i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights, and logan and nate from that same book.  none of them can talk in complete sentences.  and stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which i didn't bother to read because i just couldn't torture myself any longer.  and i'm a big fan of roberts.  i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  i'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out.",1
"grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  it would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not. for great grisham read the firm and the partner.  for very good, read runaway jury and pelican brief.  all of these are page turners.street lawyer is a stomache turner.  really bad.  what happened",0
"the sub-title of this book is very misleading. it does not contain ""an action-oriented approach"" to raising your self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action. the book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page (""one of the things i dislike about myself is..."", ""one of my emotions i have trouble accepting is..."") and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind. for some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper; and there are a lot of them, so be prepared to go through a lot of paper.sure, completing sentences technically counts as an ""action"". but if you're like me, ""action-oriented"" implies some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world, not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts. for someone with social anxiety the last thing i needed was more solitary introspection.branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy; but alas, the practice helped me in no way. your mileage may vary, but i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone",0
"i'd never read berry before, but as far as i can tell, this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory. however, it's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm. there are two related problems with the book: one of presentation, and one of tone. the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there's no room for specifics. so, while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry's vision, there's no detail to back it all up. the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at. of course, some of the pieces are lectures, but there's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book. it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of ""appropriate"", ""authentic"" and ""adequate"". when these are used ( as they often are), there he's obviously made some kind of value judgment, but the reader is never let in on it. the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir.which is unfortunate, since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things (though not his anti-abortion stance). small farms are good, agribusiness is bad, stewardship of the land is good, extraction industries are bad, treating the body as an organic whole is good, and things of that nature. alas, he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful. two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate: ""this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed."" and ""communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people, country life, and country places."" berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses. for example, in one essay, he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine, untouched state, and that's all. while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way, they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry's views on stewardship and land use. it certainly doesn't help matters that his view of small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose-colored glasses. his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition. however, it ignores the fact that, historically, small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins, was subject to all kind of external instability (weather, vermin, etc.), and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level. in farming, cash is scarce, that's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself, such as in wwii, when all those defense-industry factories were opened in california. (of course, in berry's vision, you don't really need cash, because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors.) berry's exhortations to create small-scale communities is worthy stuff, and even in cities people are creating this. the growth of csas, farmers markets, and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this. however, to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection",1
"i have never been a fan of danielle steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  i'm not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  actually, i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  the writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  it read like a poor book report:  ""...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed.""  we are told that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  when the ""proof"" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  yeahsurerightwhatever.  most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  the author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  this is how men behave and relate to one another?  i find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.  i liked the female characters of the book initially.  they all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  for instance, gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  nevermind the fact that he's known about the adult children since the very beginning.  nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy, while gray and sylvia are new yorkers.  nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  evidently gray can't see beyond the fact that they are ""kids"" and therefore ""family"" and therefore not to be tolerated.  sorry, but whatever sympathy i'd developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  dump the weenie, sylvia.  you can do better.  the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.  considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book.  and why i bothered reading i",1
"despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is not a computer crime novel. in fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal. in the first few pages we're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she's gone and the book spirals into japanese gangs, corrupt police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it just sucks from then on out. the story is good albeit incorrectly marketed. the characters however have no identity! they all sound the same, with the exception of the japanese characters. sadly the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character development, on what could've been a good story. one positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of japanese culture, etc. are really good. perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from england to japan. my advice: spend some time abroad again",1

"i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it, and being through with it now, i feel as though i've learned very little.  i had so many problems with this book, or rather the way of writing, mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author, that this was a difficult read.  in his defense, he is, in most things, very thorough.  my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was (or as he sometimes put it &quot;must have been&quot;) thinking or feeling.  while i give mr. bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject, in my opinion, that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views.  since he himself stresses that leonardo's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings, he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations.  in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo's life, the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter, but only puts forward his own opinion, and his reasons why he believes what he does, without explaining the opposite side of the matter.  in this manner, he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter.  sentences beginning with &quot;i think&quot; or &quot;in my view&quot; are not uncommon.  he also makes certain assumptions about the reader, referring often to other artists' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them.  also, he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo's, often drawing attention to coloring or texture, without ever showing it, though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout.  the author is an undoubtedly intelligent, well-learned man, very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned, but entirely overbearing in his writing.  overall, unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and don't mind being pulled out of a book by the author's views, then i would highly suggest staying away from this one",1

"so this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put catholic and fellow christian faithful in a defensive uproar. i'm fairly well read and, yes, i've earned a few bucks with my prose. i'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and old testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. ok, i decided, now that it's in paperback, i'll give it a read. what i concluded was this: those who found the da vinci code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that brown's work is a literary steaming pile. i read page after page, waiting for the moment when i would start to give a rat's ass about the da vinci code's protagonists. what a bunch of twits. langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (i don't know if i spelled that right, but i'm not about to go back in that book and check it). apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that langdon's books sell better than brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly french chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like landgon. she's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most french probably couldn't tolerate it. and then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic british snob teabing. from cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) versaille, this memeber of the royal lucky sperm club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a euro. so he's been free to pursue his fascination with bigfoot rumors about how the priory of sion, opus dei and those cool holy grail knights from the third indiana jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that jesus made a baby girl and god had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. or something like that. oh, i forgot, teabing's crippled so i should feel bad about talking bad about him. anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. the point is that these characters aren't very approachable and brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy christian faith as we know it. hell, it's been more than 100 years since darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the christian faithtul still pack churches around world. but back to how bad this book is. trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. i would give you some examples but, like i said, i'm not going back in there. one of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when langdon and sophie meet up with teabing in his metrosexual parlor. by now, sophie and langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. with a straight face, brown describes how sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. yes, crumpets. hell, teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. offer langdon a stiff drink. i sure needed one at this point. by now i'm pulling for the albino. then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to england on teabing's private jet. i hoped maybe teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his grey poupon behind. i stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. i don't know how it ends. i don't care. however, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the history channel and discovery. who knows? you might like it. this is just my opinion",1

"a favourite writer goes to prison, keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read, then, upon his release, writes the worst book of his career. the concept of the book is good, as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9-11 tragedy. the first 20 pages flow with typical archer style. then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions.my personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to canada or mexico in order to fly to europe during the 9-11 grounding of air traffic. the idea that new yorkers wouldn't know that montreal is the nearest international airport seem laughable. while there is a direct highway to montreal, archer sends the main character to toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes, is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive. once at the border, the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly doesn't know that mcgill university is in montreal not toronto as is claimed by our hero. the guard then remarks that he will ""meet"" a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference. the idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern us/canadian border crossings, with multi-lane checkpoints 24/7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality.its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story, but there is simply no benefit to this sillyness.dan cormie",1
"i might have been expecting too much, but i was disappointed with this book. i did not learn anything on dark magick per se. the first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like, goths, vampires, lost souls, the collective unconscious, dark deities, satanism and some other stuff. the second half is about magick, but it sounds more like high magick to me. where's the dark magick",0
this book disappointed me after reading martins letters. although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity. there are much better books on analysing companies i suggest financial statement analysis by martin fridson and fernando alvarez.,1
"i thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget.  i was wrong.  instead, it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, on all kinds of architectural extravagances.  perhaps this book could have a subtitle:  how to spend a million dollars on a 1,500 square foot house.  if you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply, this is the wrong book",1

"i read bill bryson's ""a walk in the woods"" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the ""educated"" aspect, bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).i started into ""in a sunburned country"" with similar expectations, and especially since i have always longed and planned to visit australia.  to state that i was disappointed is a severe understatement.  after reading this book i now have little to no desire to visit the ""land down under;"" my only hope is that i will completely forget what i read in bryson's book so that i may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting australia.  (senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)my best estimate is that bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about australia.  during and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  i have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as i did with this one.  bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a ""story"" relayed second-hand from one of the australians he ""met.""  such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.the only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  these, at least, provided for some interesting reading.after comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of bryson's books (""i'm a stranger here myself"") after she read ""a walk in the woods,"" it would appear that ""in a sunburned country"" is not the only snore-fest that bryson has churned out.  perhaps he isn't a ""one hit wonder,"" but i for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.so, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that bryson provided in ""a walk in the woods,"" look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.",1
"i must say i was dissapointed with those 2 stories. first story is so far from reality (i know, i know, sometimes we want to get away-but not that far!!!) i couldn't read even half of the 2nd story...it was written very poorly. sometimes i felt like something just wasn't enough, at times opposite - like it was way too much! anyway, i wouldn't recomend bying this book..",1
"city of the dead can't really be called a zombie story.  it's really a cheesy action novel that just happens to have beings called zombies in it.  the zombie aren't really undead like in the romero movies, but are corpses possessed by demons.  i really didn't find any part of the novel scary and it doesn't seem like the author was trying to make it scary.  he seemed to take the route so many hollywood scary flicks take and just tried to gross out his readers through descriptions of the decayed bodies of the demons.  the action is clunky and not very exciting.  his hero's are constantly stopping to argue about things like how jim's ex-wife raised their son while being hotly pursued by hundreds of demons.  there are too many parts that require suspension of disbelief: a military humvee could never catch an explorer suv, the hero's escape a fire by climbing across a ladder to the neighbor's house with the demons somehow not noticing, they're being chased by dozen's of demon vehicles on the road but second's later after crashing they have somehow lost them.  and i have to ask why keene included the descriptions of necrophilia in the novel.  in the end city of the dead reads more like a cheesy schwarzenegger/stallone/norris movie than a horror novel",0

"the content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired.  the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents.  pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to.  the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book.  you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused.  if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, i would rate it much higher",0

"this book is out of rint for one reason, it is terrible.  i am no lover of big companies but the author is so biased in this book it is hard to believe anything she says.  she blames p&amp;g for the destruction of the  environment, mistreating employees, the role of women in society and  racism.  p&amp;g has done many things wrong, most big companies have, but  it is not the cause of the fall of western society",0
"the author keeps referring to the lds church as a cult. by definition a cult is: a religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader.in christ's day many would have considered his movement (christianity) a cult by definition and now it's the largest religious form of worship in the world. so let mormons do their thing. there's upwards of 12,000,000 of them now so i guess they're not a cult anymore",1

"communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. this book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. some ""intellectuals"" actually support the tired mantras of marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, i don't know. in any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. pol pot, mao, stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding",0
"as a student of urban development and politics, i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind. davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that, by employing simply economic analysis, does not allow for the intricacies of the city's problems. class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles -- anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel",0
"this book, up to the very end was very good. with out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  the end is what ruins the entire thing. don't worry i'm not going to spoil anything. i'll just say the ending stinks out loud!this story is not really horror, its sifi. a adventure/drama/sifi. it really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. and somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. the writting was dead on as always and character development was good.  this book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book",1

"i recently decided to become vegetarian, so i got this book to read. i was very disapointed. i think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals, yet is written in a boring, scientific way. this book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians, than to teenagers. this book contains a lot of recipies, and some of them sound good, but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook. i would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians, but there are better books written for the teens themself. this book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu. i don't think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians, there is enough of that without reading about it. however, if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won't hurt, it is just a dissapointment",1
i had to buy this book for a class.  it is an extremely boring read and i struggle to keep myself awake while reading it (as does the rest of the class i am told).  it does tell you about dreamweaver though and i suppose that is its purpose.  one thing that i do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing internet explorer and other isp's.  his personal opinions are a real turn-off and unnecessary,0
"""being a lover of freedom, when the [nazi] revolution came, i looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but no, the universities were immediately silenced. then i looked to the great editors of the newspapers, whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks.... only the church stood squarely across the path of hitler's campaign for suppressing the truth. i never had any special interest in the church before, but now i feel a great affection and admiration for it because the church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral freedom. i am forced to confess that what i once despised i now praise unreservedly."" -- albert einstein. what i'm getting at here is that you can propogate anyone to look bad, that's easy. when you have two sources contradicting each other so heavily, you may want to consider the source; i.e a protestant british author writing over fifty years after the fact, vice a prominent and liberal jewish figure who lived through the holcaust and has no biased motive to either slander or praise the beforementioned institution.or maybe israel zolli, chief rabbi of rome whose conversion to catholicism immediately after the war was prompted by the church's reaction to the plight of the jewish people. this book is extremely propagated and heavily editorialized. it is important to read a work like this however, in order to better understand the manipulation of truth and half truth in the author's motive",1
"""the other boleyn girl"" and ""the queen's fool"" are two of the best books i've ever read--and i've read a lot of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. they were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out, i buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. ""the virgin's lover"" fell flat, and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. anthony trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. that may or may not be the case with gregory. i know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. so to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. they feel forced, constructed. i'm going back to trollope",1

"native tongue by carl hiaasen this book is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness.  no doubt, it is a page-turner.  and it is better than the other book of hiaasen's i have read, double whammy.  but all that does not a good read make...a strength of hiaasen's books are his characters, well defined and numerous.  most are straightforward stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist, the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars, and loads of redneck florida ""crackers"".  hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and by casting two characters that are quite original, an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman.  and we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins.  etc. etc.so what's wrong.  mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of tv-sitcom-gone-book.  it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject.  one might think that the exception is the environment, but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here.  so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment?  if you like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany ""fun"", native tongue might satisfy.  i have one additional problem with hiassen, and it's similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton.  these books stink of hypocrisy.  crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science.  hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness. while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue, i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent",1
"in his recently published history, the whiskey rebellion, william hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania. what hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of howard zinn. he has an axe to grind, and by the end alexander hamilton is the devil incarnate, and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the american revolution to its necessary conclusion.the accusation that hogeland comes back to again and again is that hamilton incited the rebellion. the argument is that because hamilton's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen's resistance, and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion.the problem with hogeland's argument is his scholarship, or lack there of. he almost never offers a direct quote, especially when accusing hamilton of malfeasance. instead, hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote. the reader is expected to accept on faith the author's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end. not all of this is hogeland's fault. the new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting, opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop. even doris kearns goodwin, a legitimate scholar, is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze.ultimately, this is the main problem with william hogeland: he is not a scholar. he is a magazine writer with an agenda, and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions. to read some radical agenda into the actions of the pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history, because there is no basis in reality.",0

"""...minus several million for good thinking...""- zaphod beeblebrox, the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxythe above quote (and the score i've assigned to this book) aren't in reference to the text or the author, but to the publishers. why anyone with the brains of a sea urchin would cross professor hawking as they seem to have done is beyond me.briefly, save your money and buy the illustrated brief history of time instead of the theory of everything, even if you're a compulsive hawking completist. alert readers should notice that hawking doesn't hold the copyright for theory of everything, and attempted to block its publication. it was originally titled the cambridge lectures: life works, and appears to have been drawn from some recordings of lectures given by the professor years ago. (see the professor's web site for details.)the ""vanilla"" (i.e., not the illustrated) theory of everything consists of an introduction, seven lectures, and an index, without *any* illustrations or diagrams. out of curiosity, i compared a library copy of it with the illustrated brief history of time.unless otherwise noted, each of the 7 lectures corresponds to a chapter of the same name in brief history, in some segments only with slightly different paragraphing and punctuation (and occasionally the kind of spelling errors that creep in when one transcribes audio narration to text, if i may speculate as to the cause).i don't understand why anyone would prefer the less polished text of theory of everything to the illustrated brief history of time, which not only has updates for new areas of research, but has been revised and rearranged to explain things more gently to the layperson.""ideas about the universe"" is essentially an extract from ""our picture of the universe"", the first chapter of brief history, with about one sentence's worth of drift per paragraph.brief history's version of ""the expanding universe"" has a more gradual introduction to the methods of measuring distances to nearby stars, and explains technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the non-scientist, such as luminosity.theory of everything really shows its age in ""black holes"" when compared to brief history, as hawking has not been idle in that area over the years. the illustrated edition of brief history has had a fair bit of interesting material added to ""black holes"", especially regarding cosmic censorship and naked singularities (hawking having made a few *more* bets on the subject with preskill and thorne, although he paid off the cygnus x-1 wager). ""black holes ain't so black"" lacks major blocks of clarification/explanation added by hawking to the version in brief history.brief history's version of ""the origin and fate of the universe"" goes into more detail: about the kinds of particles that are predicted to have come out of the big bang, and what sort of results we'd expect to see today if the predictions hold, and the scientists who first put forward these theories. brief history also contains a much longer version of the ""open questions"" section, leading more gradually up to the discussion of guth's development of the inflationary model.""the direction of time"" corresponds to brief history's ""the arrow of time"" (which is worth picking up just for the picture of the keeper of the u.s. cesium clock). brief history goes into more detailed examples to explain what hawking means by the psychological arrow of time, with the simplest kind of ""computer"": an abacus.""the theory of everything"" mainly corresponds to brief history's more modestly titled ""the unification of physics"", which is much more up to date (string theories are still covered, but a lot more work has been done in that area over the years). the tail end of the lecture corresponds to the ending of brief history's ""conclusion"".--in summary, this is interesting stuff, but the illustrated brief history of time does it better",1

"no intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal john dewey and his ""experimental school."" who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of ""progressivism?"" i would.dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. the problems in dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. as if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. even more outrageous in dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. how could dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance?deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly project follow through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. i'd personally like to see dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their ""natural inquisitiveness"" programmed by tv, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial american history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, tennessee williams, and the ""plus-que-parfait"" tense. but of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.90% of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged. maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. dewey's ""progressivism"" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. from the absurdity of it, i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. but a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one",1

"i was intrigued by his &quot;the end of history.&quot; i thought his  &quot;trust&quot; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my  masters thesis and doctoral dissertation. i only hope this latest book is a  disruption in an ongoing chain of good books. in the end, &quot;the great  disruption&quot; is a down right silly book. it has a lot of usefull data  but fukuyama's humanistic ideology clouds it all. all his empirical data  and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion:  that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good.  fukuyama proves that the moral consensus -- the social capital -- of the  earlier era has been wiped away. that crime has sky-rocketed and that the  apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high  incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men. then he turns  around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped  because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to  rebuild social capital. he doesn't bother to deal with societies -- like  ethiopia -- that have never been able to build up enough social capital. he  doesn't really look any further back in history past about 1950. his  generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken  into account the big picture of history. he thinks (based on his ideology  of human goodness) that things just have to get better. if he had studied  pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history, he would know better.  people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but  they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to  make generalizations about long-term historical cycles. for that, i would  recommend robert w. fogel's &quot;the fourth great awakening and the future  of egalitarianism.&quot; fogel, a nobel prize winner, has all the optimism  of fukuyama but with the history to back it up",1

"i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara's pulitzer prize winning ""killer angels,"" and because i'm a baseball fan.  the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  it's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  the feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees.  why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  the hawks apparently are from atlanta, but an atlanta team, braves or hawks, whichever, would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium--not on the mound on the field.this book was published posthumously and mr. shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in ""killer angels.""  it's unfortunate.there are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book",1
"i was reading about my son.  it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  when it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present.the authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which i would have respected, if not agreed with.  then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes christ into the conversation/solution.  if i knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system, i wouldn't have spent the $22.  i would have wanted to know that in advance.  tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book.buyer bewar",0

"having read a few bosch books already (the closers and lost light), i realized that i should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how bosch became the bosch i was reading in the later series.  however, i was very disappointed with this book.  one of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  i found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before i stopped reading)!  i thought it was ironic that connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  also, i found the book to be too gritty.  it lacked the emotion and soul that i found in the later books.  it seemed that connelly was trying too hard to make bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that i read.  so it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because i just finished reading the narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other bosch books and just read it out of order.  connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why i didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  i gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe i was too impatient.  this is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order",1

"the plot of this book was interesting, and it could have been a good book. unfortunately, it wasn't. the main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable, and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem! even many of the the secondary characters are weak, miserable people!the story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a ""dirty little nobody"". once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful, he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards. because she is the daughter of a ""cit"", he can't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal. he says charming things to her like ""how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway"". now that's romance! meanwhile, even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times, she finds herself drawn to him too. for me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim. she never stood up for herself, and you felt sorry for her.of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage... only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a dukes granddaughter, including her. in fact just about the only one who doesn't know is the hero, which provides the dilemma. he would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn't a nobody!will anyone tell him? will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she isn't good enough for him? will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn't think she is good enough for him to marry? of course it all works out, and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him. ugh!!!this could have been a good book if the ""mystery"" had been handled better, and the characters were written differently. as is, it is a sad regency tale",1

(p. 302)philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. a modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence. the philosophy that god does not exist is not materialism, it is naturalism. materialism is the view that all that exists is matter. materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (in a quote below, you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.)it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist, but he is certainly a naturalist. concerning the proof of god's existence, he trots out david hume's ""who made god?"" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality. i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof.let's look at two quotes, the first is at the end of the chapter ""belief in belief"" and the other at the beginning of the chapter ""morality and religion"": ""that is, isn't it true that, whether or not god exists, religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy, in the rule of law, in free will? the very widespread (but far from universal) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning."" (p. 245)"" without the divine carrot and stick, goes this reasoning, people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires, beak their promises, cheat on their spouses, neglect their duties, and so on.  there are two well-known problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true, which is good news, since (2) is is such a demeaning view of human nature."" (p. 279)in the first chapter, he mentions ""bulwark of morality"" and ""meaning."" but in the second chapter, he leaves out ""meaning.""  if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven, what is our purpose is life? whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. mr. dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians.there are worse things than divorcing your spouse. disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said. mr. dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life.the only miracle mentioned in mr. dennett's book is the shroud of turin, which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man.  since no one claims to know how the image got there, it can be called a miracle. however, mr. dennett does not tell us anything about it. the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet.",1
i had high hopes for this book. there are too many parts that feel self-serving and pointless. i felt like i was reading the author's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation. the material on ideo could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader. i found the preface by one of the author's former professors to be the best part of the book. i would not recommend buying this book,1

"if you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. and despite his &quot;official religious disclaimer&quot; at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. if you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading",1

"if you don't know much more about woodrow wilson than an overview of the important events of his life, this book isn't going to help much. there's very little political analysis, almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties wilson needed to overcome, and no passion at all in the writing. actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade. auchincloss talks a bit about the two wilsons (one good one bad) and hints at wilson's dependance on women, but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently. maybe woodrow wilson's life is just too large for a book this small",1

"this book has major shortcomings; stein's obsession with character over plot, for one (martin amis said, ""i used to sneer at plot until i wrote a novel that had one, titled night train. it was hard and i used stay awake at night hoping i wasn't leaving any holes.""), another being his obsession with ""show don't tell"" (gabriel garcia marquez's novel love in the time of cholera is probably the greatest novel of the 1980's and it's almost entirely ""tell"" and very little ""show."") and the passages stein includes from his own novels as examples of good writing were actually examples of terrible writing! (a taxi ""disengorging"" its passengers is categorically bad writing.) and stein admits he rejected frederick forythe's the day of the jackal. i wouldn't read a book by dick rowe about how to make it in the music business (rowe famously rejected the beatles from decca records). stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline, but then rowe was going by just a demo tape. better writing books are out there",1
"this is definitely not one of my favorite books about stocks.  the title of the book is a little deceiving, the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits.chapters 1-4 are about general info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for a long time. you must research the stock before purchase, eps must increase every year.  i didn't find anything in those chapters that i didn't already know. chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell. once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip.  chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques, the bull put spread.  this is not something that i use or will use in my trading. chapter 12 is the concluding chapter",1
"it's always easy to criticize somebody's personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars, but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable actresses and not stars of the studio era. so it comes pretty natural to ask : is esther williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook margaret sullavan? was grace kelly's talent so overwhelming to forget that miriam hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as lubitsch, wyler, mamoulian, hawks and vidor to stunning results? what was wrong with mary astor's acting  and what is right with kim novak's ?  actress to me means patricia neal or shelley winters - norma shearer or natalie wood were stars....think about it",1
"this book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than i am.  but while i was reading, i kept asking myself, ""when's he going to get to the point?""  the first part of the book is all about why it's good to be rich--something i thought was unnecessary.  the bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle-class and poor.  finally, in the last part of the book, he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy.   this was the only part of the book i was interested in.  to me, it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30-page book on investing and so kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with ""fluff"".  however, even his advice is considered questionable by many experts.  i would say that the main idea i got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd.  i just wish i hadn't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise",1
"in 1980 michael weiner saw the publication of weiner's herbal: the guide to herb medicine, which states the medical benefits of marijuana [7]. however he recently stated that the chemicals in marijuana make it too dangerous to be used as medicine. on his program, he strongly cautions against the recreational use of marijuana, occasionally devoting his show to ""marijuana horror stories"" and its claimed potential to ruin lives. he has authored a number of other books on various herbal medicine topics under this name. more recently, savage's books are political in nature and published by wnd books, a partnership between the conservative website worldnetdaily and thomas nelson, a publisher of christian books.in january 2003 he published the savage nation: saving america from the liberal assault on our borders, language and culture, his first book under the pseudonym michael savage. the book quickly reached the top of the new york times bestseller list earning savage, as noted above, a commentary show on msnbc. the controversial book directs attacks at ""media bias"", the ""dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'"", gays, and liberals.critics have faulted savage for making a number of assertions in the book that he often fails to substantiate with facts or resources. exacerbating this condition is the fact that the book itself has no index. the book is divided into two- to four-page sections, many of which are near-exact replicas to columns he published on the conservative site newsmax.com.in january 2004, savage published his second political book, the enemy within: saving america from the liberal assault on our schools, faith, and military. his newest book, liberalism is a mental disorder was released on april 12, 2005. both of these books contained citations of nearly every assertion made, contrary to ""the savage nation.""in january 2006, savage announced that he would be releasing a new book, the political zoo, in mid-march. [8] the book will contain satirical profiles and cartoons of different people in politics as animals in the ""political zoo"" including one of savage himself, who will be portrayed as the zookeeper. savage has remarked that the book will be ""easier to digest"" than his previous political books.books as michael weinerplant a tree, new york : collier books, 1975 bugs in peanut butter, boston : little, brown, 1976. man's useful plants, new york: macmillan. 1976. earth medicine, earth food, new york : macmillan pub. co., 1980. the way of the skeptical nutritionist, new york : macmillan, 1981. nutrition against aging, bantam books, 1983. secrets of fijian medicine, quantum books, 1983.

[2] some of his letters to ginsberg are held in ginsberg's archives and one of those letters describes an encounter with a young fijian man. [3] savage denies writing the letter and called it part of a ""smear campaign"" by ""gay fascists"". [4] savage also once posed naked for a photograph with ginsberg while swimming in fiji. [5] ferlinghetti views weiner's reincarnation as michael savage as ""total opportunism,"" the crowning achievement of someone who was ""always looking to make a fast buck"" and ""always trying to think up new schemes to get famous.""michael savage began his radio career in 1992 on san francisco's #1 news/talk radio station kgo, first doing fill in work for other hosts, then getting his own show on the weekend. two years later he was given a weekday show on kgo's sister station ksfo where he shared airtime with a liberal talk show host. he chose his ""nom de voix"" in ""the tonga islands in the 1960s. i stumbled upon the name of a [19th-century] shipwreck who was locally infamous -charles savage. his exploits were legendary,"" he said. ""so the name was bouncing around in my head."" at the time, his slogan was ""to the right of rush, and to the left of god."" on january 1, 1995 he was given his own show during the drive-time hours. the show quickly became a local hit. in 1999, he came to the attention of the talk radio network.on january 17, 2000 he started doing an additional two hours of radio which was broadcast nationally. for the next eight months, savage would spend a total of five hours a day just talking. his national experiment was a success, and on september 21, 2000, he stopped doing separate shows, beginning a full three-hour national show. after just one year, he was in 150 markets. by 2003, he was in over 200 markets and is currently the no. 3 radio host in the united states.in june 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station ksfo who refused to renegotiate his contract. he was off the air for three weeks. on july 1, 2003 he began his show on a different station: knew in san francisco. since that dispute, he speaks badly of ksfo and of ""vanity or pretty boy"" sean hannity, whose show replaced his on the station. savage also speaks pejoratively when referencing his fellow talk radio hosts or individuals with whom he disagrees (see list of michael savage neologisms).as of 2005, savage has between 8 million and 10 million listeners per week. this makes his show the third most widely listened to broadcast in the united states.in 1996 he applied to be a dean at uc berkeley's graduate school of journalism. when he was not granted an interview due to lack of qualifications--less than two years of experience in radio, with a ph.d. in epidemiology and nutrition science--savage filed a discrimination lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. the position instead went to china scholar orville schell who, according to weiner, was less qualified than himself.savage was hired by msnbc to do a one-hour show starting march 8, 2003. on july 7, a mere four months later, he was fired for making anti-gay remarks in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller ""east coast bob.""savage was doing an ""airline horror stories"" piece, when bob called into his show to talk about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom. his next words were ""half hour into the flight, i need to suggest that don and mike should take your show so you can go to the dentist because your teeth are really bad"". the words after ""should"" were bleeped out by a msnbc exec, which would make one believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about savage's sexual orientation. savage asked if he was a ""sodomite"", to which the caller answered ""yes"" . savage then said to the caller: ""oh, so you're one of those sodomites. you should only get aids and die, you pig, how's that? why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. you got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage, you got nothing better to do today, go eat a sausage and choke on it. get trichinosis. now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? put another, put another sodomite on....no more calls? i don't care about these bums, they mean nothing to me. they're all sausages."" [6]before the show was canceled, msnbc was replaying his show during primetime hours saturday night; many believe the show would have been canceled even without his comments, and that msnbc was simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure from special interest groups. others point out that msnbc has had poor programming and ratings performance for a long time and that many talk shows of all different political stripes have come and gone quickly on the network.",0

"am i the only one who didn't get a complete book? at first i noticed there was some poor editing - lots of typos. but then after page 180, where page 181 should be (sleep chapter), it goes back to page 117 (discipline chapter that i already read). it continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 (a whole 63 pages duplicated!), then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the school days chapter that i don't have the beginning of. i'm completely missing pages 181-245 (67 pages).other than that, good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas",1
"i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but i have to admit i'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i've baked from it so far.  i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter.  i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.so i was a little skeptical, and then reading through the recipes, although they are very clearly written, there aren't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes.  the book already assumes a level of competence.i made three recipes from the book: the essential chewy sugar cookie, the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie, and the fudgy brownies.  all three recipes tasted delicious, so i can't complain there, but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes, and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much, and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies. i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results, so right now i'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up.  i think it's okay for a ""base"" cookie recipe book, but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients",1

"the book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on the riders was interesting.  however, the author included a lot of details that just really didn't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts.  the photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book.my professor was able to bring dr. schrag to talk to our class.  he was a good lecturer-keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the metro.  if he could make his writing style more like his teaching style, i think he would have much more success as an author",1
"ed klein is really so desperate in his attack that he can't find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against hillary!    what a lot of misinformation and outright lies. to actually accuse marian wright edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal, and to insinuate that chelsea was the result of a rape, even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant, is disgusting.    i should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were monica lewinsky!",0
"the topic of this book is very interesting: espionage in the revolutionary war. unfortunately, ""washington's spies"" goes into so much nit-picking detail that, as the cliche goes, you can't see the forest for the trees. to really get anything out of this book, you'd have to be a *very* dedicated revolutionary war buff. it didn't have much appeal at all to me as a general reader.",0
"there is no doubt that antonia fraser's ""the journey"" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although i must say that i never before heard of sex described as ""lugubrious."") there is also no doubt that fraser has done a great deal to redeem marie-antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the french people. the book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. however, i was disappointed to see that fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. for one thing, why does fraser act like marie antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? what about sophie of anhalt-zerbst (catherine the great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? this sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. i was glad that fraser did not fall into the myth of louis xvi's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. she simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed ""it."" but never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. i must say, it is a first. fraser insists that marie antoinette slept with fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. i usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but i guess fraser does. oh, well. it is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. i found it absurd when fraser insists that the tormented queen of france was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the french people now enjoy. if the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. for a better study of marie antoinette's relationship with her husband, i would recommend vincent cronin's ""louis and antoinette."" as for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of delorme and bertieres will soon be available in english",1
"you get your money's worth here--there are a ton of cds in this audio book. unfortunately, i found bryson's prose (which i enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as i have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. to me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of ""moist"" sound when he pronounces words. hard to describe until you hear the cd, but trust me on this one. i think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the cd. i would stick with the written word on this one.",1
"i picked this up because it's considered a classic and i knew it had been made into a movie.  i tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  not so with howard's end.  the plot in howard's end doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  you have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  none of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  i kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  the story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted margaret to henry.  there definately is an audience for this book.  i'm just not a part of it",1
"i'll start with the positive:  the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  in short, it was a competent work of fiction. that's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  but that's not true, is it?  so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.alright, here are my problems with it:first, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  in term limits, vince flynn just beats you over the head with the ""power corrupts"" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist.  you know what, though?  there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  in this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.second, murder is a viable answer.  this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  come on, get real.  this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  and, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn.  murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  elections apparently just get in the way.third, the balanced budget.  for years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  the book makes it the central theme.  balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  it's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  a coup!!!  yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite vince flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that now!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it.  this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  it's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?- cv ric",0
"i truly wanted to like this book.  after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i'd feared but downright enjoyable.  in addition i'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  ""captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last.""  alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books i've ever forced myself to finish.this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a ph.d. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  so what went wrong?  how did this novel end up so awful?  the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.length: if ""brevity is the soul of wit"", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  at 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  it would seem that, to some extent like melville before her, naslund confused length with importance, but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.the name dropping: one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  they are badly handled here.  an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century new england and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne.  one or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  as it is, it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).the politics: even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  however, naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.the anti-christian bigotry: there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time except christianity.the farfetched scenarios: i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians, leaving her free to ""marry"" captain ahab (una never really ""marries"" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  riiiight.the mary sue: however, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a ""mary sue"" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  a more realistic main character might have saved it.  una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  she doesn't change because she is already perfect.  she doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it.  i feel like i've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom... with the door locked.",1
"i personally do not see how this book could have won a newbery medal. while the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. the fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving sara starving for parental care. finally, christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. this book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and i would not recommend it to anyone. i wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours.",0
"this is another piece of lowbrow anti-german propaganda dressed as historiography.the book is a mess of primary, yet selective and biased historical research, simplistic psycho-babble, ridiculous sociological-anthropological speculation, pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least, absolutely third rate military history. the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler, that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives.all in all, cheap trash billed as history.",0
"alright, for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, i say this: who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  who is rand to say what substance is?  you've got to look at her bias, first.  realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  as if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today.  but i doubt it.though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  but she doesn't.  thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  all books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your iq.  any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns.rand, at least as portrayed in what i've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   the pieces of art she says are empty are empty, absolutely.  they don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  nothing to offer her, that is.  how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling other people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) what they should read?  truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  they have their bias like anyone else.i say read in variety.  observe art outside of rand's choice of art.  take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  if you then agree because you agree, then i say great.  its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address.  she says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  she says be an individual, but only i know the basis of who you want to be",1
"a book full of heartwarming stories from country stars, singers, writers,  and listeners, or so the back of the book said.  as i read some sentimental  stories, and some down right boring stories i questioned how more than half  of these stories got into the `country1 edition of the chicken soup series.   i loved about three stories, liked about ten, and was puzzled by all the  other entries",1

"what is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book -- which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel -- is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24.  nope, the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced ""the great gatsby"" a mere five years later.         ""this side of paradise"" is a mess: it is as uneven, affected, feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero, the tiresomely self-conscious young minnesotan-gone-to-princeton amory blaine.  (one suspects, in fact, that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory's diary the result would have been considerably more readable -- or the book's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable, at least.)       that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 -- it was to prove the most popular book, in terms of sales, ever produced by its author -- presumably speaks to the public's recognition of something new and revealing in it.  okay, amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype; and the drinking and shameless smooching (etc.) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably, one can accept, a revelation to see in print (and likely a titillating one) for an american audience raised on mcguffy's readers -- and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war.  welp, here it comes:       ""on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon, the `petting party.'       none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed."" to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is, of course, very small beer.  what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now, in the best cases of the paradise narrative, as unalarming quaintness. while this is not exactly fitzgerald's ""fault"", so to speak, it is also true that the use of ""shocking revelations"" of this type -- scandals specific to a place and time -- represents a risk a writer takes: the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and/or universal in such episodes.  in any event, the price the reader pays here, in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory's adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties, is very, very high for payoffs of such modest proportions.  i mean, come on: ""for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart.  the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds, he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it.  eleanor was, say, the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty, the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes.""yikes.  i don't care what new generation you're talking about, can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody?  (can it represent anything to anybody?)       there are things to like, even admire, here and there in paradise.  fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark (e.g., ""they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered."" ""sometimes i wish i'd been an englishman; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy."" ""it's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much better."")  and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator's observations is, in its now-curious way, refreshingly, bracingly funny: ""slowly and inevitably, yet with a sudden surge at the last, while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht], war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played.  every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings.  when amory went to washington the next weekend, he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back, for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks, he guessed, or russians.""nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there's a war on, i always say.         anyway, most of the novel consists of young amory's elaborate ponderings -- romantic, philosophical and egotistical -- which are as forgivable as they are forgettable.  i've forgotten them already. at some level, in any case, fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character -- who was, of course, a not-very-disguised version of himself.   for how else, if not as commendably self-deprecating irony, are we to take this observation? ""amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant.  scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him, and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours.""       in the end, in any event, one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs. fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder.  in paradise almost nothing works: form, content, narrative stance, dialogue, character development, pacing -- you name it, it's a problem.  yet in gatsby, five years later, everything works -- everything.  if there is to be a great american novel, it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor.  while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b, the fact is that he did -- and without point a the journey could not have begun. so while ""this side of paradise"" hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon, it surely deserves our respect, and indeed our gratitude, for what it led to.",1
"in the chapter about south asia, the authors have written quite a lot about the &quot;kashmir problem&quot; but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350,000 kashmiri hindus that took place in 1990. i just cannot believe that they don't know about this",1

"i bought this recording with high hopes.  what better complement to reading shakespeare than hearing him, right?  well, not with this recording.  the cast is made up of &quot;distinguished actors,&quot; the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the shakespearean line.  the speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a monty python farce!  when there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  for audio recordings, you need the best voices.  too bad arkangel didn't realize this.  my advice?  grind up these cds and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums",0

"i'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read ""grapes of wrath"" or ""east of eden.""  instead i have focused on ""of mice and men"" and his lesser known works, such as ""to a god unknown"" and, my personal favorite, ""pastures of heaven.""  i've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.when i began reading ""in dubious battle,"" it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck's work.  telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac's radical cell.  there is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - mac and jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers.  early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.suddenly, steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again.  after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, i expected the sense of excitement to continue.  it simply never does.summary of ""in dubious battle"" - workers get mad.  workers get tired.  workers get mad.  workers get tired.  workers get mad.  workers get tired.the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking.  and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book.  most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense......and eating.  steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) talking about food.  there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters.  but i advise any reader of ""in dubious battle"" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down.  you won't miss anything.  nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.i suppose now i'll give ""grapes of wrath"" a go.  perhaps if it isn't one of his ""greats,"" it isn't worth reading",0

"i am vietnamese and i grew up in new orleans during the 80's and 90's when the first waves were settling down there.  i hate to tell this to everyone on this site but this book is the worst piece of fiction ever written.  like many books written by someone who does not belong to the culture that he writes about, the book takes great liberties with the imagination and presents the stories from the viewpoint of the writer and not the actual people.  the vietnamese characters in the book are portrayed as backwards, uneducated, and simple.  further, the stories are depressing and very few of the characters seem to have any success. if you actually grew up in new orleans during the time that the vietnamese americans were setting root during the 80's and 90's, you would know that by and large, the community pulled itself from nothing to become quite successful.  no real vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book.  i repeat - no vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book.  the book repeats many of the fallacies that i have noticed in other books written by predominantly caucasian male authors about east asian culture.  there always seems to be 1) an asian prostitute 2) caucasian guy with asian bride 3) asian male in an emasculated role 4) asian people as backwards and simple.  quite sad.  this book reminds me quite a bit of memoirs of a geisha, though that portrayed japanese culture in a better light.  by the way, the lady on which ""memoirs of a geisha"" is based and written about was quite upset at the author of memoirs of a geisha and did not feel that it portrayed her life or her thoughts in any way at all.  regardless, if you really want to find out about the vietnamese american experience you should really read a book written by a vietnamese american",1

(oh, bloody hell, did i just say ""please""?)despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place, i have to wonder if she's experiencing the effects of projection. in explaining how rude we humans are, it was necessary for her to be quite rude, as well. it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer: i also found her supermarket incident, in which a kid shouts at his mother, ""i want that one, you effing bitch!"", among others, a bit offensive.as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness, i was often thoroughly appalled by this book. no, my friends and i don't usually hold doors for each other, but, in general, i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown. frankly, i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends, as well as strangers, than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others. i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation, or, if they must answer, they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them.i have to argue that we are not a select group. in today's world, one sees what one expects to see; one is treated as one expects to be treated. ms. truss, i believe, would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could, she would be surprised to find that, when people are rude, she cares less because she knows that she, at least, is doing her best not to be. if she did this, maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior.my last complaint is this: ""gluten crap""? you would think that such a sophisticated, eloquent (as she is dedicated to proving) person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year, am-i-not-so-cool-and-bitchin' (?) style word ""crap.",1
"there is only one 100% whole grain bread recipe in this book.  most of them are less than 50% whole grain.  if you want healthy bread recipes try ""breadtime"" by cheney or ""the laurel's kitchen bread book"" by robertson.  every recipe in both of those books is 100% whole grain.  i doubt that most people considering a book titled ""whole grain breads..."" are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients.  with that being said i thought the book had some good recipes and was well written.  therefore, i am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none.",1
"this book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing...his book is mostly life-stories...and stupid ones at that...some teeter the line of racism, he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil ""fat black woman"" and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book, i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on ""race"". and besides that, his 2 or 3 spells and such are old and tired...and there is no ""self-initiation"" for the type of voodoo he's talking about...i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money, i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing. if you looking to learn about voodoo or vodun this book will not help. his title is also misleading because ""voodoo"" ussually refers to hoodoo and ""vodun"" ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one....he's just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life-experiences are even worth tellin.this book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back-ground to african based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much.....this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about",0

"while this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses, i cannot recommend it to other readers. the author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical christianity. she battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel. indeed, in reading some of the chapters, it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a christian worldview that might veer in any part from republican platform positions. this is really too bad, because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions. i would not have begrudged her political point of view at all, had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position",0

"reading through john irving's ""the cider house rules,"" i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. in obtaining a bachelor's degree in english, i had to read a lot of books. among them were many books that i did not like, but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety. every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. people become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. the book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. there are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. i don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. it's as though the author is god, and the characters completely lack free will.and then there's the ""protagonist,"" homer wells. i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, homer wells barely does anything in the story. he barely even speaks during the story. he is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr. larch, but even melony seems more real than homer does. the story is very long and rambling. subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with debra pettigrew). after such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). to spoil the plot just a little, homer wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. i personally am pro-choice as well, but i found that homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters",1
"i'm a wiccan who formally practices within a traditional gardnerian coven, but practices eclectically within my private practice. i read this book because i had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a christian; purportedly, wicca's charm was written by an impartial writer. immediately, you realize that this isn't true. catherine sanders has a clearly stated agenda: that wiccans are simply misguided and  misunderstand that what they long for is offered by christianity. i could write a long review debating the merits of sanders' arguments. instead, i suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which sanders claims to have thoroughly researched. she relies on the writings of margot adler, carol christ, starhawk and phyllis curott (with barely a nod to scott cunningham and ronald hutton) to draw many of her conclusions. yet, missing from her notes are such writers as the farrars, merlin stone, raymond buckland, isaac bonewits, patricia crowley, and the matthews, to name just a few outstanding contributors to neopaganism's base of knowledge. too often, sanders relies on the statements of young wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive. in another case, she bases her thesis that women's spirituality (e.g., goddess worship)is misguided and that christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via one speech that she heard margot adler give shortly after 9/11. sanders requests both christians and neopagans to read her book with an open mind. a fair request. but as you're reading, closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind, or whether sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that christianity has everything that a wiccan desires. one needs to go no further than to consider that as sanders attempts to persuade the reader that christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of paul.",1
"i enjoyed the parts regarding the s.s. valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. except for picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. the whole &quot;adversarial&quot; situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard",0

"this book is a small bundle of common knowledge wrapped up in an insulting amount of hyperbole and hucksterism (and very bad english).  just how many times can you claim a technique will improve your workouts ""by a factor of ten"" or is the most valuable breakthrough ""in history"" before you lose all credibility?in the first 30 pages, winnowing out the fluff, i read this:1) fad diets, bulimia, and steroids are bad for you.2) gaining muscle and losing fat are biologically distinct processes, so they require two classes of exercises.3) it's good to concentrate your attention on the particular muscles you are using during weight-training routine.4) creative visualization and self-hypnosis can help you reach your goals.  (ok, i'm a bit skeptical about this one.)in other words, this book has taught me nothing of value that i didn't already know.  looking ahead in the index, i can see much more of the same.  i'm afraid i've been had.i bought this book on the strength of amazon reader recommendations.  please don't make the same mistake.  look, to gain muscle, lift weights every other day and eat lots of protein; to lose fat, do cardio on off days and watch your total calories.  if you're already doing those things, don't bother with this book.  i was looking for more specific tips, but i didn't find them here, and neither will you",1

"let me say right off the bat, i am a skeptic, but still i loved author gary goldschneider's first two books from this series: the secret language of birthdays and the sl of relationships.  but this one, the secret language of destiny is a bore.rather than offering two pages to each birth date, as birthdays did, or a half of a page as relationship did, this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods. this information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you don't fall asleep reading it.for this reason, i do not recommend the secret language of destiny. -- regina mcmenami",0

"the author is reusing a similar plot device than in ""twisted"":  a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. that is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes.the narrative in general is not kellerman at his best, either. the characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do. a small part of the book talks about brazil, and kellerman simply invents a couple of portuguese words making them sound spanish:  (""favilla"", ""favillitos""). one wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional.in sum, a book carelessly executed",1
"the author of this book, warren wagar, is apparently a professor of ""future studies."" i certainly hope he has long been fired from that post. ""a short history of the future"" was  written in 1989, but the writer is so ignorant of politics, and so wrong, to be blunt, it reads as if it was written in the 1940's. orwell's 1984 is more on the mark than this. he shows barely any creativity in his ""predictions"" and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time. the fact that he assumes the soviet union will continue plodding along well into the 21st century is incredibly naive. the fact that he assumes the nation's socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre. did he read the newspapers? did he pay any attention to that gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing russia down? and honestly, did anyone really expect that germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal?  or that latin america and africa would remain dictatorships forever? or that black rule in south africa would not occur until 2014?if this book had been written 30 or 40 ago, it would be excusable. this book is just sloppy. he doesn't even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world. everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations. like ""and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose."" that sort of thing. the author is clearly an ""ivory tower"" academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague ""trends."" the fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future.",1
"reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it. for one thing, the author still talks about the ussr and east germany, and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated. it's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future.",0
"i have reviewed all 31 chapters of psycho-babble in the book (and the epilogue too).a very ""nice"" read. indeed entertaining and yes, funny in many ways. they also use doubtfull suggestions -  like bringing ""doughnuts"" because people like them !?they also ""demystify"" some ""myths"" about teamwork. (i do not know where they got those myths from) - another fragment of their imagination, i suppose.this ""business"" book is more of a ""romantic novel"" about something relating to ""teams"", full of anecdotal references (very life-like) - but totally unsubstantiated, wanting us to ""believe"" that indeed, ""teams things"" are like they describe it.from an entertaining point of view - very. from an academic point of view - null. for a business person - if you have time to waist, have fun.it is interesting to note that they got a uk award for their book.

"i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others, hoping to learn about america's prison system.  i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic.  unfortunately, in the first twenty pages of the book, elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10,000 citizens.  if you do the math, that equals 7% of our population. 7% of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york.  according to this author, there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york. before you get too worried, let me reassure you that this is not the case.  america imprisons 736 people per *100,000* citizens (as of 5/06), or .736% of the population.  this is the highest rate in the entire world, so there's no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic. for comparison, stalin had .771% of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges.  again, there's really no need to exaggerate america's rate of incarceration. what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page, but is repeated several times.  apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7% of our population, and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well, as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover. personally, i can't take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out, on the first twenty pages no less.  if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10, how do we know the rest of the book isn't off by a power of 10? elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine.  don't buy this book",0
"i m not a big fan of communism, nor of stalin. but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin. in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war. dont waste your money on a propaganda book. better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer, thats what biographies are supposed to be",0

"from a sociological perspective, hustlers, beats , and others serves what it set out to do, explore the sociological aspects of billiards in america and the culture that has accompained it through time. however with the  recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society, many of his  observations and conclusions are dated if  not false. te book just goes to  many places, crime, pornography, etc. and fails what it set out to  originally acomplish. furthermore, i find it quite unusal that the author  chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . is  this not a sociological perspective, or an historical editorial.as a  college student, and a sociology major, the author fails to win my support  from his argument. all in all, quite disapointing as i found it at my local  bookstore and the cover looked interesting. i was left with a feeling of  disappointment when i finished this book, as it completely crushed many of  the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture  of billiards. stick with the sociology, cut the editoria",0

"one tiresome, heavy-handed simile after another; agonizing, descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action; simplistic, trite phrasing and dialogue -- characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence, an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat; routine characterization; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable; proofreading errors; fragmented, poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish writing all the way around.  i cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received.  i cannot understand the lack of proper editing.  i am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm, so imagine my disappointment when i was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the prologue!  in fairness to the author (and with a hopeful attitude), i forced myself through the first 70 or so pages, however with each turning page i found myself reading along just for sport, my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous (and annoyed) with this juvenile effort. what could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time.",0
"i'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i can't decide among the following:    * travels through guilt with the world's 33rd richest hippie    * the mind of an empty suit    * a self-important revisionist history    * how i learned to hate myself and love the third world    * memoirs of a cold war paperpusherconfessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition.the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world, when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry. if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy, then the moral outrage of this book makes sense. but there's a whole lot to swallow.on the plus side, it's a fast and somewhat entertaining read. otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface.one of the things that i've had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny. as i look at the 20th century, i think of most of it focused on the economics of . perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation. he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america, rues the lives of poor peasants, and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism.perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist. a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric. but you can't imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx, weber, engles, friere or anyone. back when i was a bit more blackified, i referred to such people as culture vultures. if it's indigenous, it's good. but you'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics, literacy rates, crime rates or even inflation.i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil. technically, you'll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia. basically, perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet, his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is, was and always will be the american way. you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins, who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game. it's a confession all right.by the time i got 2/3rds of the way through, reading the book began to become annoying. the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering. there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of. he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning. it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory.  we learn that he took one of his charges (female) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean, but that when he got there, he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees.if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance, the best book i've read is my life as a quant. if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy, the best book to read is larry kolb's overworld. if you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era, then this is your book. but it's nowhere near as good as, say the quiet american.you can imagine that perkins, who is a great admirer of graham greene, might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen. he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus, but he is to honest to consider himself heroic, and i suspect that he'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life. in that regard, 'confessions of an economic hitman' is (now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition) a blueprint for american liberal guilt. if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown, it is john perkins. he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american, down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine. you'd think, being a pseudo-economist, that he'd have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton. ahh but that would mean that he'd have to admire courage.i didn't want to be a harsh judge of perkins. i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life, one of conviction and then epiphany. instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through.  someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that 'corporatocray' is evil. this book has been a disappointment in many ways. i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this.good parts?yeah there are a few. he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders. he gives a few details about saudi aramco. but compared to larry kolb's fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi, this is romper room. if perkins thought he was an agent... don't make me laugh",1

"ok, i know i'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. but i just have to be honest: this is a terrible story. ok, being that it's shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a horrible story, and i can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. perhaps they feel that shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it is a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if i could believe it. but given that it is a shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a ""happy"" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. or perhaps people believe (i've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that kate has actually ""triumphed"" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. even if this were true, i'd hardly consider it a ""happy"" anding, and personally, i see little evidence of it.no, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there is a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who ""tames"" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to behave as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a ""comedy"". this is absolutely the worst of shakespeare's plays",1

"a subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball &quot;nuts&quot; who grew up in new york.   we idolized the terribly tarnished ccny &quot;wonder five&quot; who set an unbreakable record by winning both the nit and ncaa titles in 1950 (it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled). this book is a fictional addendum to rosen's non-fiction treatment of the original basketball &quot;scandals&quot;, as he outlines in his npr interview. unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors -- broadway and 43rd street cannot be on the east side of manhattan; madison square garden has been on 23rd street, and is now above penn station; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th streets and eighth and ninth avenues.  these errors are particularly galling in a book by a new yorker who played at hunter college, and they undermine the author's credibility and care in writing. since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence, the game of who is this really is inescapable.  hence it is most unfortunate that rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers, and &quot;a couple are in the hall of fame.&quot;  this tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as bob cousy (holy cross, '49), dick mcguire (st. johns, '48), bobby wanzer (seton hall, '46), and frank mcguire, the legendary coach at st. john's, north carolina and south carolina",0

"cooper's book is yet another warm and fuzzy management guru text --- from yet another management guru who never served a day as a real manager, of a real company. it contains all sorts of motherhood and apple pie stories --- along with trite sayings such as &quot;when you find a back door that's open, close it&quot; or my personal favorite &quot;use the lanterns of your life to help light the way.&quot; if you're looking for an inspirational book, one with a solid basis, forget this one. you'd be better off reading the daily horoscope",1
"i received my ph.d. in theoretical and applied mechanics from one of the best u.s. universities, and for more than thirty years was teaching and researching in the field of solid mechanics.  before starting the reading of this book, i was in the agreeable mood with the author's that machines can never be human, and that ai will retain (if not forever) for a very long time its name - unreal.  but, now, i am dismayed.  the author unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and physics to support his point of view, making simple topics sound difficult, and making diffcult ones look impossibble.  the inclusion of his strange tilings is strange.  all in all, the book does not make sense. moreover, his 'note to the reader' (which is patronizing, arrogant and deceiving), and his prologue and epilogue (which are at best cynical) should have warned me not to venture any further.  i cannot help feeling sorry for myself and for several other readers; and most of all, if this is the author's usual way of communicating his ideas, for his students.  luckily, i did not buy this book; for one person, who could not stand reading through it, dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor",0

"well, the fact that i'm writing a review about this book, while it's sitting open on my desk next to my computer, open and not being read, might be some evidence of how i'm enjoying this book. this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn't be so difficult. this book is not clear or easy to understand at all. every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote, and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page (!), making this work look like a research project for a phd publication. i have the casebook in this series, and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity. and it turns to be true! this book might be good if you're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail, or as an advanced reference later on, to look something up like in an encyclopedia. some concepts, which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book. it's too complex for a first-year student. sometimes it starts describing the different views out there, and then there's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is. i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors.",1

"this book is terribly organized.  i'm not sure what happened in writing this book, but it seems clear that professor jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in.my main complaint is that rather obscure concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to, and then only later does jones bother to define them.  (i would almost prefer that he not define something at all, rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!)  the fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book, yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate/first reference to the concept.examples are numerous, but here are a few:**robe nobility: referenced on pages 139, 152, 183.  defined? (pg. 183)**sans culottes: first referenced on page 189, defined on page 231.**louis-sebastien mercier: referenced on pages 11, 138, 178, 189, 200, 204, 212, 213.  when did jones provide information (that he was a ""journalist, dramatist and observer of parisian mores"") on just who mercier is?  page 215.aside from that, there are some plain old errors.  one such is in the text box on saint genevieve.  jones mentions that she negotiated with frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s.  she died in 512ad, so the negotiations seem improbable.  (470s & 480s would be correct, but i should not have to figure that out.)the redeeming quality of the book is that if does offer information on paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances.  and paris is not such a bad subject",0
"this is my first ludlum book and it is sure to be my last.  the plot is preposterous because of ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history.  once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away.  it starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some ""weapon"" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars!  hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania.  some spoiled, rich american brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history.  i know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest.  if you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department",1

"firstly, let me say the research nicholas lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the existing literature. his data sources are vast and highly informative.  the major limitation of this  publication is that the central argument is biased. lardy selects those  data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view. as a  result, major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in  transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over.  lardy's view is  the typical western, dare i say &quot;american&quot; argument. primarily he  uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of china's  state banks. this methodoloy is extremely poor - particularly in the  context of china's trannsitional economy. financial criteria are a horrible  guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency. if anyone would  like elaboration on this point feel free to email me.  in summary, lardy's  book is informative and makes for interesting reading. however as a piece  of economic analysis, its usefulness is limited. the major reason for this  is a total lack of economic theory(as indicated by the previous reviewer)  which has resulted in a poor methodology",0

"i was eager to read this book, but after reading it i was left completely flat.  the rest of the iceberg?  hardly.smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading sports illustrated, or any minnesota sports page.  he admits he's not a fan of football, but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career.  this book is touted as: his full and complete story.  so we learned he was watching ren & stimpy during his nfl draft.  wow, are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read?how about telling us more of the inside details...  how did smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player?  who were his friends that he could trust, and when did he need that trust?  what thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent?  what was he doing when he was ""goofing off and missing class all summer"" which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at ohio state?  when, and why did he begin using pot?  if football is not ""smart"" enough for him, why doesn't he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging?  what happened to plans for medical school?  we know the stories of football; those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented.i also felt smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of america.  who is attacking him?  why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much?  highly paid athlete stories are, sorry for the pun, a dime a dozen.  he tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy.  the truth is, many people will take a job for 5% less than a co-worker because yes, they value things other than money, and yes, they are happy to have a job.  leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers, it felt like i was reading an average high school creative writing project.  'i did this, i did that, i went to bed, next day.'  half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy: pop music.  smith notes ""less than 50 percent of americans read at a 10th-grade level"".  well, this book certainly won't tax the reading ability of too many people.one lesson from this book is that smith had opportunities to swallow his pride, take some coaching, and come up with a better solution.  this book is another one of those times.  he should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance.  build the characters; help us feel their stories.  instead, smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions.  sorry, but compared to other autobiographies, this was not an emotional book.i'm sure smith is all the things that mike gutter says he is, such as: thoughtful, honest, trustworthy, dependable, passionate...  but i felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book.  instead, we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg.",1

"this is the latest in a never-ending series of books trying to generalize non-business world (eg. sports, armed forces, girl scouts, religion, nasa, etc.) management techniques to the business world. most, possibly all, are of little value because of major differences. 1)members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently, and face greatly significantly different situations. what does eg. a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist, nurse, professor, financial analyst, etc.? i have no idea. 2)key success factors vary from one business to another. for merck, it may be speed of developing new drugs, getting through fda approval, and motivating physicians to use them. for nucor steel, it undoubtedly rests much more on low-cost production. again, what does either have to do with fighter pilots - little, if anything. one is better off reading books from similar situations - eg. about wal-mart (if you are in retailing), about allied-signal or g.e.

"written in cartoon format, i thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight, dry, biography of scientists.  however, it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids.  the cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known, so using it as an initial reading is impossible.  further, some content is offensive.  on the second page of cartoons, a scientist is walking along a bridge, thinking, when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump, saying, ""no woman is worth committing suicide over.""  the pictures show a scantily-clad woman (with bare bottom in one frame) that he is now picturing in his mind.  irrelevant and inappropriate!  plus, i didn't have to go far to find swear words in the captions.  yikes!  my kids will never see this book!  it is not even appropriate for high-school age kids.  (in fact, it isn't even funny to adults!",0
"phil jackson groupie and sometime espn.com writer charley rosen turns in a fun, but sometimes off-putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life.  he develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot.  however, rosen's personal oddities drag the book down.  rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting, urination, defacation, etc.  at times, the book reads like an immature third grader's delight.  my roommates and i all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable, but charley rosen is a really weird guy",1

"this book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every american president. each individual section includes a brief summary of the president's successes and failures while in office. the ""secrets lives"" aspect includes a description of his temperament, character and personal habits. for example, john adams is said to have been vain and irritable, while frankin pierce is depicted as an alcoholic. also much oddball trivia is mentioned, such as that george washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood. the biographical information is at least somewhat educational, especially on the lesser known presidents such as millard fillmore and zachary taylor. but most people who study history will already known much of what is written here. the truth is that o'brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials. but rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few  books, such as ""the reader's companion to the american presidency,"" and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining. also o'brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars.however, what i found most disturbing about this book is o'brien's tone and attitude. his so-called ""humorous style"" is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents, especially those he dislikes. for example, he jokingly suggests that andrew jackson had ""some unknown frontal lobe damage"". i have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president. in fact, i disagree with much of jackson's presidential agenda, especially his bigoted policies directed against american indians. however, i also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that o' brien uses. overall, i found the book to be juvenile, mean-spirited and overly negative. there are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there. so don't waste your time on this one.",0

"i read this book on a suggestion from a friend, before i read ""reviving ophelia"", because she wanted to see if i would be as dissapointed with it as she was. i was more so. while there are some outstanding essays in this collection, the bias of the editor clearly stands out. there is no one for the outcasts to relate to. there was no musician, nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. there were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had. the sections are poorly named and divided. all in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original. some girls it may ""make feel less alone"", but for me it only accentuated the differences. definately take out from the library before you buy it",1

"typical feinstein (""a season on the brink"" excepted).  quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc.  this book is about the 2002 u.s. open golf championship at the bethpage black golf course, a new york state park course on long island.  the subtitle, ""inside the ropes at bethpage black,"" is used here as a figure of speech, meaning ""behind the scenes.""  (""inside the ropes"" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.)  feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion.  we see u.s golf association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and u.s.g.a. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the black golf course.  yet the book does not fulfill its promise.  my guess is that feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis i had hoped for",1

"i admit that i tried to read this twice and failed both times.  i got to around page 20 or so.  i'll probably try again.  however, if you're an adult who has already read other philosophies i would suggest attempting to read it just so you'll know what objectivism is about.  i wouldn't suggest it for teens that haven't had any prior readings, though.  objectivism is about the self and about ""reason"", and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else. the strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous.  i assume that's in my head, but judge for yourself.  her caricatures of ""the witch doctor"" (who controls others from a spiritual perspective) and ""attila"" (who controls by brute force) are actually interesting.  wrong, but interesting.  since objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival (or think they do, anyway), it's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book.my suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand (she's not wrong on everything), or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills. judging by previous reviews, it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers.if you buy into it, you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way.  if you don't buy into it, however, you're evil (either the witch doctor or attila) and probably just too stupid to ""get it"".  why i didn't finish it yet...i just couldn't get past her ignorance of history, frankly.   if you're writing a work of fiction, the historical innacuracies don't matter, but this isn't supposed to be fiction.  i like history and most people don't, so it probably won't bother most people. also, while she denounces religion, ms. rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself.  like all other religions and cults, the world is messed up basically because people don't think like she does.",0

"the novel, a northern light, by jennifer donnelly, is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage farm girl, bound for a great future.  jennifer donnelly relates to mattie gokey, the lead character, in a way that they bother grew up in rural side of new york.  donnelly attended the university of rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children's book. her novels include, the tea rose, the winter rose, a northern light, and a children's book, humble pie. all of her novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book, a northern light, has also been introduced in europe under the title a gathering light.	a northern light reflects a lot on the issues of wealth, education, love, and murder.  the combination of those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and relate to.  as you read this book, you feel like the main message is the traditional cliche of following your dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. but as you read further, you realize that it's a lot about hardships, strength and love.  on the first page of the book, mattie is imagining a perfect day at the glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly tells herself, ""i believe these things. with all my heart.  for i am good at telling myself lies"".  from this quote, you can see the type of person mattie is, and it gives a foreshadowing to the events that would take place throughout the novel.  the events typically consist of let down after let down for mattie and her hopes for her future.   	this book is written from mattie's point of view which really helps the reader to get to know her better.  it adds a different element to the book that wouldn't be there if it wasn't written from mattie's point of view.  it lets you get inside mattie's head and feel the emotions that she's dealing with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations.  mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she wants and yet there is always something holding her back. she's stuck in a farming town where education isn't as important as having a prosperous farm and a family. as you read this book, you just want to tell mattie that she needs to take her own future into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some faith.  she is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and everything to keep her family and her farm doing well.  she deals with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her mother died.  she has to learn that the promise that she made to her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care of herself as well.  royal loomis enters mattie's life at a very unconventional time when mattie's unsure of what she wants to become and she has to chose between his love and the life she's always wanted.  mattie deals with her teacher, miss wilcox, leaving town.  miss wilcox was mattie's role model who was living the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle.  the life mattie wants.    	this book is intended for a female audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl could understand.  it's a fairly easy read so it is more for adolescents than adults but not for young children.  the issues that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college and leave their families.  a northern light is full of valuable lessons, but most of all it's just a good book to get lost in.",1
"as i sat here writting this review my rating dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating, and i now realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily been diverted if the book were titled ""drawing people: a technical guide for beginners"" and mentioned nary a word about the clothed figure. then if i had of stumbled upon this book it would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to outline some basics on clothing and drappery, instead of a full out disappointment. not that i blame the author solely, most of the blame lies at my door. i was so overjoyed in finding a book that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed figure, brune hogath's book aside (another devastating disappointment), and that it was written by a professor from the academy of art, a school that i am still deciding on attending, that instead of going my normal route (ordering the book through the store, checking it out in person, and then ordering it online so i could get a fatty discount) i impulsively bought the book, only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the customer reviews (which all looked favorable). now i realise my folly, and am yet determining whether i'll pay for it (i.e. keep the book).i guess what all of my harping boils down to is the lack of content instead of the quality, for i can easily discern bradley is an excellent artist with years of knowledge garnered from experience, and i'd say that experience shows equally in all areas, not just clothing but in setting up a composition and following through. the problem is, at least in my opinion, that this book is supposed to specifically address clothing, and it doesn't for the most part. roughly one fourth of the book pertains to clothing, the other three fourths talk about:             how to properly hold your drawing implement, how to properly position yourself if you are drawing                                 from a live modle, maintaing a daily sketchbook, researching your subject matter, the relationships between       the head neck and shoulders, drawing hands, drawing feet, drawing eyes, and a whole slew of other. . .i wouldn't say irrelavent, because they are relavent, but not neccessarily the most important topics pertaining to drawing the clothed figure.a refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing materials, and bradley does on one page with chicken scratch detailing. it should outline some of the rules when dealing with how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips, again something bradley discusses on one single page. the differnce between water logged clothing and dry clothing, she didn't bother mentioning that. how pants typically bunch up while you're walking seen from the head on, profile, three quaters, and back view, another topic she failed to mention. some examples of evening/ formal attire vs. day clothes, how clothing reacts when the subject is in motion, how jackets restrain your actions and bunch up, the effect of wearing multiple layers at once, achieving that perfect windswept look, and all manner of other topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide.maybe i'm being too harsh on bradley, after all she does mention in her preface that there aren't a whole lot of books pertain to drawing the clothed figure, and compared to the standard ""how to. . ."" books she's leaps and bounds ahead of the rest. oh yeah, that's another thing, she doesn't outline any steps on how to achieve a realistic rendering like- first start out with a cone pointing upward then draw a sphere at the bottom/base. the sphere represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length eventually enveloping the sphere. note the ripples. -or some junk like that. back to me not being to harsh on bradley, i guess in reading she is/was a professor in the arts i thought she would have some understanding of the common impediments modern day artist face when depicting clothing.for all who have read this drawn out rant, two maybe three people, and think i'm all talk, trust me if i had the skills i'd come up with my own series of ""how to draw. . ."" books and address all of my issues. as is i'm pretty good at drawing dynamic figures, but the second i add clothing they become flat, lifeless caricatures and i don't see this book as alleviating my shortcomings much. as is my own artistic habits (drawing from magazines, online pics, and occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in motion) are a match for the few helpful hints in this book. you're better off doing what you've always done plus artistically drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time then buying this book.if you do know of a book that addresses even half of the afore mentioned topics, if you could write a review mentioning them, somehow recommend them to me or whatever i'd be eternally in your debt",1

"there is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from how to cook without a book: recipes and techniques every cook should know by heart, by pam anderson (not the big-breasted one), and that is the art of the highly marketable title.for starters, this artful moniker really plays on the single gal's fears about never being able to put together nutritious, attractive, varied, affordable, and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week. you want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world.so the plus side of this book is the title. that's where it ends. the big idea here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook by: a) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation, and b) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques. sounds interesting so far, right?well, the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on ""canned low-sodium chicken broth"", which i think is a bit of a weird ingredient. it's even included in the salad dressings. other big hitters include: heavy cream, butter, and sour cream. do people really eat like this? regularly?why not make the easy fruit parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal? just take a tall glass, drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream, then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar, and some berries. repeat until the glass is filled.crikey. sour cream, brown sugar, and berries?!? wouldn't it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of greek honey? am i totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing? or, if calories are no object anyway, why not pick up some baskin robbins' rocky road on the way home from work? that's easy and it's worth the internal havoc it will cause.oh, and here's a sample mnemonic device that i can't not share, it's that good:""cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil,then toss in some pasta that's fresh from the boil.""pure genius, right? right. in a way, the author was right - i can cook all these things without a book. but why would i want to",1
"a little less psycho babble and a bit more logistical information would have suited me better.  ms. cantrell spends the majority of the book being a relationship/marriage counselor, and though it's true issues become larger in smaller spaces, there are more issues for women cruisers than just their relationship dynamics.  as i said, practical logistical information would have suited me better.",1
"i didn't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are. i am disappointed that the ""notes"" are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical. key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation, rather key terms are defined and that is all.",1
ms wilson needs to make up her mind whether to write a book of literary criticism or a biography.  the book suffers from too much critical analysis of sassoon's poetry and not enough about his life.  either he was an extremely boring and prosaic poet or ms. wilson needs to delve deeper into his intellectual and emotional development - really his cricket exploits and his hunting prowess does not lend anything to the very essence of his life.  ms. wilson's prose is turgid and repetitive. an extremely disappointing work,0
"this book is a cure for insomnia.  if i ever have trouble falling to sleep, i'll just dig out my old ""flatland"" book, and i'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later!  listening to the a. square character telling us about his flat, two dimensional world is not thought provoking, its just confusing!  trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing.  i mean i understand what flatland would be like, but only after i carefully think out what mr. square is saying.  i spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of flatland than i do enjoying the story.  not very interesting at all, even two stars is being generous",1

"i love mysteries set in ww ii and like old time radio so i couldn't wait to begin this one. the ""hero"" is a junior varsity tom joad but,ok, i was game.  the cast of characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be interchangable ""baddies"" and ""goodies"".  they were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and i pushed on. then when we got to the jersey shore, i found out that in 1942 with america fighting for it's life against fascism, and losing, our hero knew why.  all the servicemen were bullies (a drafted station employee) or morons (the coast guard beach patrol).  the 4f ""hero"" was the real mccoy however.  although not actually mentioned i bet he wished that dratted ear injury hadn't kept him from joining the abraham lincoln brigade.  he was moderate enought to think marxism had some problems; the murder of 10s of millions of ukrainians and the nazi-ussr pact probably and i say probably, didn't elude our observant literary genius.  he was also a 1975 era feminist; all those plucky ww ii women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support.  most big businessmen, probably wearing spats and silk high hats, were the bad guys needless to say.  i wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book.  i couldn't finish it and it's a point of honor for me to finish all books.  then in the bio it all became clear.  the author was a flack for former congresswoman pat schroeder of colorado.  i'm still haunted by her rictus grin and constipated, quaker schoolmarm expression that said ""somebody, somewhere is having fun and i want it to stop now!!!""  anyone who could stand to work for pat could write this book with ease",0
"many words - few practical tips! this book did not give much more (-valuable-) information than i already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer. after reading the book i still had to search for web communities, where some of my questions could be answered. my expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks, contacts and appointments. unfortunately, in my view, these important and basic issues were treated too superficially.",1
"unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, i would be astounded.  save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  by the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read english very well or are shills for mckinsey",1
"after reading this book, it was apparent to me that the author was implying that nixon was a dark and grumpy man who needed his image repackaged.  mcginnis boasts of nixon and his pr teams ability to hide the &quot;true&quot; nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image.  he proclaims that the real nixon was the one that the country saw debating kennedy on tv in 1960.  nothing could be further from the truth.  first off, nixon won the 1960 election but did not contest the results for the good of the nation.  all historians admit that jfk had help from daily in illinois and lbj in texas.  furthermore, in the 1960 debates, nixon had a high fever and was recently out of the hospitable and jfk's staff broke into the basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat! if anyone decieved the voters with his image, it was jfk using his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and jfk the family man and the idealist.  jfk exploited the missile gap, had numerous affairs, assassinated ngo dihn diem, wire tapped martin luther king, screwed up the bay of pigs, and had ties to the mafia!  now, i could be wrong, but jfk's campaign sounds like a true selling of the president.  'selling of the president' has little credible content but infact is a good historical document that portrays left wing propaganda of the 1960s",1
"if you like physics, this is just an interesting book. it mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. mr. mclaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; i don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. he even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical. well, even if he is right, which i hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, i prefer science fiction. tomorrow i'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book",1
"dr. hawkins first book, power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology.  however, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  there are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  the actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.  hawkins explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality, history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters.he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths.  he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth.  hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method, as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod.  i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in those areas.  for now i'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world",1
"my blood was boiling as i read other customers' rave reviews of ""the prince of tides.""  whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  someone was even audacious enough to compare pat conroy to virginia woolf.  what a joke!  woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  she cuts to the quick, whereas conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  one can almost see conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  i laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  in the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  they do not speak in reams of figurative language.  i cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  also, conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (i make that claim as a southerner who lived in nyc for four years.)  it's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (john irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the english language and for real american literature (cheever, plath, hemingway, cather, etc.).  don't be fooled by all the fools out there.",1

"i got the impression that rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor. it was superficial, with such helpful hints as &quot;people come in all sizes and shapes,&quot; and &quot;people with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly.&quot; i didn't need to read her book to figure those out. her logic is also flawed. she states that, &quot;doctors touch patients, not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients.&quot; did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them - not because of any power status? using the book to promote her feminist beliefs, numerous typographical errors, and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer",1

"i am ashamed to say i read this entire book. i kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. it is filled with typos and poor organization of thoughts and topics. clarkson actually spells mel gibson's name wrong several times throughout the book, and refers to lethal weapon director richard donner as ""dormer"" for several pages! he jumps back and forth from one movie production to another making it difficult to follow. lastly, he relies on the accounts of people who had met mel gibson at one time but who had either a personal or professional conflict with him. in the retelling of these conflicts and what went down, we hear one point of view only - and generally that is the view of someone who is harboring bitterness and resentment towards gibson, so their accounts are slanted and untrustworthy. the best part of the book is the end for two reasons: clarkson finally gets to gibson's most recent project, the passion of the christ. the subtitle and the picture on the back of the book gives the impression this project will be a major focus of the book, but after 300 pages of reading, i was still waiting for the subject to come up. i have to say i felt that this was the only well written part of the whole book - thoughtful and interesting. the second reason the end is the best part of the book is that it was finally over. i'm sorry to be so blunt, but i can't help it. i highly recommend reading the book about the making of the passion of the christ - you can learn a lot about gibson there - but i cannot recommend this biography",1

""yellow teethed""  ""sallow skin""  ""dirty hands""  ""tear stained over powdered face"", it goes on and on.  i wondered if the author was uncomfortable women?  i looked online for some information about maugham.  to my surprise i found out that maugham was bisexual.  he did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men. in no way can i say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book -- but in some way it answered my question or concern.  instead of this book i'd recommend the following classics:  beautiful and damned by f. scott fitzgerald, madame bovary by flaubert.  at least in these books, maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional -- good or bad.",0

"for the most part, the author seems to have pretty  good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the  book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs.  problem: no  tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and  a half after the writing. aside from that and a few other points, though,  the book is good reading",0
"this is the worst book of shakespeare criticism i have ever read.  bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next.  it reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly, handed to a graduate student, and entered into a computer over a weekend.  he contradicts himself several times.  i donated my copy to the library as soon as i was done reading it, so i cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur; but several times i recall reading a passage where bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier.  to make matters worse, he even says the bard contradicts himself.  he points to supposed paradoxes regarding hamlet's age, stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30.  apparently the point is that if shakespeare contradicts himself, so can bloom.  bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that hamlet is a slacker.  he has not grown up yet.  that is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom.  some of the book's observations are interesting, but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from bloom's notes.  interespersed between the passages scribbled down from bloom's lectures are outbursts where bloom reminds us that shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer, in verse or prose, who ever lived.  bloom is a great critic when he still tries, but in this book he was not even trying",0
"this book is a disappointment.  it provides little insight into the life or personality of robert redford, the actor or the person.  the book is basically a chronicle of the movies rr has directed or in which he has appeared as an actor.  but even as a filmography the book fails.  the reader learns little about the creation of each movie or the relationships among the actors beyond the anecdotes that have been repeated numerous times on tv or in the press.  in addition, the authors have the annoying habit of consistently putting down robert redford with snide remarks.  there must have been something about the actor other than his white teeth and good looks that made him an international superstar.  for sure, it must be difficult to write a biography of such a private person as robert redford.  however, it is the responsibility of biographers to gather information and gain an understanding of their subject, and if they can't do so, then there is no book",0

"i know all this stuff seems like a good idea but have we forgotten ghb? that was supposedly the fountain of youth a few years ago and now no one hardly even talks about it. let me let you in on a little secret, ghb turned out to be a very addictive substance and in fact a handy little trick to get a girl naked without any problems like dinner movie or even her knowing you for that matter. like hgh, everyone jumped on it before all the data was in. please put your money away and be safe. a pretty face isn't worth the trouble this could potentially cause. and lets be realistic at 60 you really won't ever look 20 again and the weight you would have lost will be the money leaving your pocket book and not the fat from your thighs. work out, do yoga, and eat a healthy vegetarian diet and you can't go wrong. also, when i stopped eating sugar the cellulite also disappeared and so did those extra pounds",1
"talk about taking the joy out of an experience.  i read this book prior to a week-long trip to venice.  this book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives.  it is a poor &quot;guidebook&quot; and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue.  the history and art of venice are covered better in books from those genres.  the only upside is that it is short.  yuck, what a waste of time.  my advice is:  get a novel about venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book.  at least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails.  actually, in terms of a travelogue, &quot;vendela in venice&quot; far surpassess any other venice book i have seen.  although i originally bought it because it is considered a children's book, it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it...",1

it is fiction of course. it can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is impossible! many reviewers are upset. upset perhaps but they should not be worried. the church is protected by christ's promise that it will not err. any person of faith sees this book as fiction. it is a poor attempt to disguise greely's left wing theology as fiction. the message to those liberals who find &quot;hope&quot; for their cause in this book: it ain't going to happen. recommended reading: &quot;women priests and other fantasies&quot; greely and his followers are delusional,1
"though i am not a vogue reader, i picked up this book out of curiosity to see what anna w's splashes in the tabloids were all about.while the subject is only mildly interesting to me, the author's prose reads like a 300+ page deposition against anna wintour from everybody who had/has a major or minor gripe with her. it's a heavy and boring read.gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining, should remain light and diverting. in this book, it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. i was very happy to put it down. perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job. but then again, when that time comes, anna wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest",1
"i was rather disappointed in mr. peterson's work. he dwells much too long on trying to convince us of &quot;the problem&quot;. nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload!  even after wading through the  numbers and graphs, i am still skeptical of his conclusions and would  caution readers to do further research.  certainly the baby boomers are an  aging bulge in the population of the us and will create some challenges.   however, the author fails to mention the &quot;echo boom&quot; (baby  boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over the impact  of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every  year.  both of these facts will &quot;soften&quot; the impact of the  &quot;gray doom&quot; that mr. peterson tries to create.  i just don't  anticipate the tremendous problem of which  he tries to make us aware.  but  i did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth  control will have on our future. another disappointment was very little  discussion of aging trends and buying habits. despite these shortcomings, i  enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and  the impact of aging populations",0
i was really looking forward to reading this book since i am both a brain researcher and a professional musician. first it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework. much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted. even this was sparse at best. he attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it. however it became too watered down and even lost me. lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments. pushing the envelope of science should be  award enough. for these reasons i can not recommend this book,1
"this was the only bertrice small book i could find in the gift shop of an airport.  that should have been warning enough not to buy it.rosamund was an unlikeable character.  she left her 3 young daughters so she could ""make love"" constantly and then was oh-so-superior with her maid when annie did the same!  i guess being a rich, snotty noblewoman means you're not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere household help.i found the love at first sight meeting to be flimsy and contrived.  small's readers are smarter than most, so i'm surprised she expected us to swallow it.  like some other reviewers here, i thought it was more lust than love.  it was clearly a mid-life crisis hook up for patrick.  and if rosamund truly loved patrick, she never would have left him when he was ill, memory loss or not!not planning to read either ""rosamund"" or ""phillipa"", the other books in this series.  it was hard enough getting through this book, let alone another one with her uppity daughter.the good stuff?  getting to meet patrick leslie again.  but it was heartbreaking to witness his grief over losing his daughter janet decades ago.  if you've read ""the kadin"", you know that janet eventually returns to her home, but only after patrick has died",0
"at first glance this is a great book. however, once you've read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration. the author, illustrator, and publisher should be ashamed of themselves. we all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on tv and at the movies, but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children's books as well? this is a clever book and i was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series. the greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind, however",1

"chris bohjalian is a gifted stylist, and it pains me to give this book such a low mark.  it's hard to say much without giving away the plot, but i found the plot contrived and manipulative -- too clever for its own good.  the book started strong, but as the main character became more disassociated with reality, i became more disassociated with the book.  i finished it, but it was a struggle",1

"first off anyone who gave this book five stars was employed by the publisher to up the rating that simple. i mean look at some of them they are so cheesy one of them actually refers to the author as mr. miller who is he brown nosing for sounds like a greeting card they are so ""textbooky"" and insincere. the book itself is almost entirely filler on how to read music (which half the music books in borders are or they are just giant scale books that are reemed out like saw dust totally useless,  which leads to the great difficulty on how to actually find an explantion to this jargon and then someone comes along and says they have an answer that will make things clear but then they fall short)  up until half the the book and many times periodically things are just repeated terminology loosely defined such as hook which is just recording industry jargon not theory. book never goes into the physical principals that would actually explain some things in it as to why the notes themselves are in the order they are such as acoustics, never got an answer as to what a whole step or a half step was by the way and when i asked many teachers and questioned them they knew nothing or gave a circular answer defining it themselves without an outside reference only to find that they were just parroting it all along. the problems with this is everything is assumed in the entire field. i recommend the only book that i have found that made some sense to me called fractals in music by charles madden much more organized and assembles things from the very beginning working into more and more complex shapes and structures.",1

"i admittedly have not completed the full book, as it is thick.  however i do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for dfss.  for example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there doesn't seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems.  i therefore think the book is more about six sigma than dfss.barry",1
"this is a decent book on photographing artwork -- but not the the most comprehensive.  the strengths of this book are that mr. saddington (1) discusses the use digital media, and (2) makes the process of photographing artwork very user-friendly by providing great visual references throughout.  the user-friendly aspect is the book's strongest selling point, especially for artists who are new or novices at photography, or visually oriented (i.e., no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures).  mr. saddington's book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure/photograph, and provides a concise explanation for these results, and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure/photograph.  he also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing.  the weakness of this book lies in the general details provided ... unfortunately, mr. saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting ... i base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called &quot;photographing your artwork&quot; by russell hart.  if you buy mr. saddington's book, i'd recommend supplementing it with the purchase of mr. hart's book.  the two books complement each other.  where mr. saddington's book lacks in details, mr. hart's book fills in the information gaps.  on the other hand, mr. hart's book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations ... so if you're a visually-oriented person, mr. saddington's book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process.  again, mr. saddington's book is decent, but it should be used as a supplemental reference, especially for the visually-oriented person",1
"first off: i'd like it better if we had 1/2-star options. judas unchained really doesn't deserve a 2, more a 2-1/2 or 2-3/4.i have a love/hate relationship with peter hamilton's books. he's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but, as with a lot of these hard-science, libertarian sf authors, he badly needs an editor. i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel, pandora's star. he also has far too many ""main characters"" who (despite 800+ pages) never seem to come alive. they all speak with essentially the same voice. and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped '60s era hippies -- come on, does anyone seriously say ""dude"" in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century?and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young (or rejuvenated) women?hamilton's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best. on the one hand, the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed, represented and believable. on the other hand, the dynamics of the relationship between ""old timers"" and ""first lifers"" is unsatisfactory. in four centuries, for example, no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty? perhaps the commonwealth's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here, the government (controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties) controls it. another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life didn't change -- i mean the characters of a novel (almost by definition) are dynamic, go-get-'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die. why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime?the aliens are ok. the problem with them (and this is true of nearly every sf story) is that they tend to be one dimensional -- they're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up. (this is a problem in fantasy stories, too.) on the plus side, i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien ""deus ex machina."" ozzie's adventures in ""wonderland"" (i.e., the silfen paths) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge doesn't really help anyone defeat the primes.overall, if you started with pandora's star, you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained. if you haven't started down this ""silfen path,"" i recommend alistair reynolds, tony daniel or iain banks. they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date",1
"camenson definitely has experience in this career with many &quot;career books&quot; to her credit.  however, there are better books out there on writing with more information. this book follows the same old tired format that vgm books are 'not so' famous for.  the internet has more info for a lot less money",1
"ernest hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author valerie hemingway's story. for that reason this book merits only two stars. early in her story of meeting hemingway in spain in 1959 at age 19, valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, ""around him everything came to life....there was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb.""when she stays focused on the story of ernest hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of ""a moveable feast.""but the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. as a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as a. e. hotchner's ""papa hemingway."" the two years she spent living and traveling with hemingway through spain, paris, key west, cuba, and america, share as much space as her weird marriage with hemingway's strange son, gregory (apparently the other ""bull"" referred to in the title). it shows the continuing vitality of ernest hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a valerie hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man",1
"the author gives vague advice, the ""calm down"", ""be objective"" cliche  advice. if you don't believe me, i'm literally quoting him.although the author tries to make his book seem original, as you can read, it's not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances, but mixed with the generic advice i mentioned. this is not something revolutionary, this is rehash. save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation, you don't need to read hundreds of pages to do it, or spend $ on what to imagine",1

(although the author does mention at the end of the book that tcl was proably a bad idea.third the author should have introduced autoconf very early in the book instead of waiting untill chapter 10.the main thing that i liked about the book was the good intro to programming with linux in general.  the topics of linux debugging and makefiles i thought was good (assuming you have experince in these areas on other platfoms).also the coverage of sdl was a pretty good intro.",1

"there are no doubt a few nuggets of wisdom in this book, but they are buried too deeply in bureaucratic gibberish to be worth digging up.  this book has no bibliography, no index, mediocre footnotes, no serious useful conclusions or strategic summary, and a disturbing combination of american-centrism (on page 71: &quot;in the asian continent....(t)he first driver will be the future u.s. role in asia.&quot;) with a lack of intelligent presentation.  there are exactly three figures and seven tables in this 336 page book, when there should have been at least 30 tables and figures illustrating specific sources of conflict in relation to specific countries.  the world conflict and human rights map (8 pages of graphics and 8 pages of fine print) out of leiden university does vastly more to inform than does this book.  this book should never, ever have been published in its present form--i venture to say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited, with graphics and good synthesis, it might be worthy of a second look.  time is the most precious commodity in the world--rand managers and editors need to get serious about how they present possibly useful information to experts who want to know what rand thinks, but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome undisiplined--even lazy--preparations.  the topic of this book is extremely important--those who would invest their scarce time and money in doing research in this area deserve better from those who put together this book",1

"i didn't have especailly high hopes for this book. i think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of hh books over the years, and this one brings it to a new low. basically, it's waaaaaay too long. at 850 pages, it's a monster read, and a slow one. that's not always a bad thing - sometimes if you like the characters it's nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page. but not here. why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language? for several paragraphs? more than once? why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services? i think i'd be in a very small minority when i confess that i quite like the 1662 prayer book, though i can't quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it's been out of use here for decades! maybe it was easy to cut and paste, and got the word count up.and then there's the space combat - a strength of the series, especially the first three or four. but there's the rub - there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing up. by the 11th book in the series i can't be the only person out there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the battle sequences.but the big problem - spoiler alert! - is the way in which weber solves the love triangle we left the last book with. honor loves hamish. emily loves hamish. hamish loves honor and emily. what to do? it turns out that there's an easy solution. after about 400 pages of agonising (not to mention most of the previous book) it seems that honor can marry them both. a bit outre? seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well within the accepted norms of manticoran law and custom. (although we've never had a whiff of this before.) but what really gets me is that the reason it didn't happen about halfway through the last book is that (get this), gosh, no-one thought of it. it seems that no-one ever told mr weber that if you shoot someone with a gun in act v, the gun better have been hanging on the wall in act i.all-in-all, i can only say, please mr weber. it is time to bring the series to an end. please do it soon",1

"the joke here is that krugman is convinced he can write.  he ends his little intro with the smug assertion that ""maybe economists can write after all,"" offering himself as proof.  (krugman cannot write well, but he has mastered the clumsy, undistinguished style of a bad lit professor---the kind of tenured mediocrity that dominates academic publishing---an accomplishment he's very proud of.  to use his own favorite ""emphasizing"" gimmick: krugman stinks---full stop.)the punchline is that shortly afterward, the new york times hired him.  it was a match made in middlebrow heaven.  (i should add that i do like the substance of krugman's newspaper articles, if not the style.  an enemy of the current white house is a friend of mine.)as far as the economics go, he's pro-nafta and pro-""free trade"" just like all establishment economists, and completely unwilling to critique the real forces at work in international markets.  don't waste your time",1
"i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee.   the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background.   because it's an autobiography, i don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it is about him.   i do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.   it's an okay addition to one's list of books about everest expeditions - which i must admit, i've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading ""into thin air"".   i wouldn't, however, use it as my primary source for information or impressions",1

"this book was so simplistic. i was quite disappointed. you get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all. a worthy goal, but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies i really think one should try to pursue things to their limit. he really held back from delving into any dark territory. his explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit. he always managed to put a happy, positive spin on everything, which is nice, but life isn't that simple",1
"this is the sort of book for paranoid people addicted to conspiracy theories. they would rather believe a fanciful lie than the mundane truth.though i don't agree with most of what's written in this book, i don't regret buying it. it teaches me how to con ignorant people with high tech jargon and conspiracy theories. if people believe that amalgams or metal restorations are the cause of their headaches, fatigue or whatever symptoms, then removing them will definitely cure them. that's how faith healing works.the only reason why i don't use amalgam in my practice is because i do cosmetic dentistry. if the patient does not mind the colour, amalgam is definitely a superior direct filling material for class 2 and subgingival preps. i have absolutely no qualms about having that done for myself.toxicity? sure, some people are affected by amalgams and anything can be toxic to somebody, but let's not forget that these cases are extremely rare (perhaps less than 10 on this planet and most of them would be chinese). there are literally thousands of tests and studies establishing amalgams as safe filling materials over the last 100 years. there are numerous studies that show how safe amalgams are. if dr breiner has been to asia where we have much healthier diets and lifestyles, he may notice that we also have many healthy 70 to 90-year-old asian men and women who have gold and amalgam-filled teeth in their mouths.are composites totally safe? the incidence of allergic reactions to composites (very low) is higher than that of amalgam toxicity. this is something the author failed to inform us. all his anecdotal evidence are almost laughable as they are not supported by independent studies and sceptical parties. not one case he mentioned can be conclusively attributed to amalgam. mercury can be very toxic, but after tituration and amalgamation, the metal remains in the solid state and is not absorbed by the body. it's different from inhaling mercury vapour daily, injecting or ingesting mercury or mercuric compounds.at the end of the day, propagating such beliefs will only spark panic, paranoia and various psychosomatic ""illnesses"". following breiner's protocols for ""detox"", patients will only be paying a fortune for otherwise very simple dental work. gosh, with so many gullible patients in america, i should probably move my practice to america and start doing amalgam detox instead of honing my skills for cutting crowns, bridges and sinking implants",0
"what a chore this book was to read.  if it weren't for my ocd about finishing books that i start, i would've read the first couple of chapters and then given up.it seems like a wannabe-suspense, but it's not.  it seems like there might be a love story in it, but there's not.  it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it, but there is not.  what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy.  she tries to make a connection, but falls way short.  read vinegar hill - that one was worth it.  pass midnight champagne by",1

"grudem seems to have a very distorted and confused vision of christ.  we can only hope that evangelical become more like christ.  jesus was the first real liberal and the most radical of liberals.   if jesus of nazareth was anything, he was an extraordinary friend of the down- trodden, definitely a liberal, whose advocacy on their behalf so infuriated the ultra-conservative religious and political leaders of his day that they had him killed to prevent the public from hearing the very liberal teaching that you will see quoted abundantly in jesus' own words on this web site !         those who actually know what the bible says about the life and teaching of jesus recognize that far from being like jesus of nazareth, today's ""religious right"" are much more like the kind of clerics who battled this revolutionary prophet from the day he opened his mouth until the day they had him nailed to a cross.  although these people claim to represent jesus christ, they rarely quote his teaching or follow his example.  what they do instead is use his name (""in vain"")  to promote their ideas, ideas which jesus himself did not teach, and might well have opposed.",1

"if you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. the symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. if she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student",1

""dancing the potty mambo""? give me a break!2. stupid advice. this book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he/she is an adult. i'm sorry, but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out explanation of why you want them or don't want them to do something. how about just saying, ""don't do that!"" or ""hey, you want to try this?"" that seems to work just fine for me. why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something? what's wrong with just telling your kid what to do (nicely), and expecting them to be obedient? 3. repeating content. this book kept repeating itself over and over. okay, i got it already! i strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages (or less).4. too many references. this book constantly refers to other chapters. i once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page. i am not kidding! huh? is potty training really that freakin' complicated? all i want is some general ideas on how to go about it, how to get started, and a few good tips. i don't need all these detailed references. (nor do i need the phrase ""potty mambo"" repeated to me ad infinitum.)here is all i wanted to know:-how do i get started?-what do i do?-how often do i need to try it?-should i go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment?maybe this book got to all of that, but i quit after page 60. i just couldn't take it anymore. after hearing the phrases ""stay positive"" and ""potty mambo"" repeated to me for the umpteenth time, i had to quit. i returned this book and got my money back.if i were to say anything good about this book, i would say that it has a few good tips, surrounded by about 180 pages of filler.potty training still looms ahead. will i be successful? probably. but to this book i say, no thanks",1

"overall, i found this book disappointing.  in its defense, its basic thesis of the movement of jewish american orthodoxy towards the `right' (more closed and intensely religious) is interesting, and i am sure accurate, and heilman's analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched.  however, i was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray hareidi society through the prism of its own value system, or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all. heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader, and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations. examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture.  hareidi society has its own worldview which, although too complex to elaborate on here, has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values, reasons which heilman completely disparages or ignores.  (for an example of a book that is not written by a religious author, yet is able to appreciate hareidim from their own perspective try ""real jews"" by noah efron).  in general, i found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct (i.e. a defensive reaction to the holocaust) to be grossly insensitive to the hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition. the latter half of the book i found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information.  for example the juxtaposition of poster a condemning something to a poster advertising b implies that poster a is condemning b as well.  or two posters (put out by the same company) advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music.  in conclusion, although i eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent, my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information.",1
i have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask. i have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it. although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail; it just doesn't click for me. i f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline. surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but i just cannot do it my self,0

"when i discovered the existence of this novel, i was enthusiastic and intrigued. unfortunately, my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages. kleopatra focuses on the famous queen's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family (something she may have compensated for in adulthood). what i liked: 1). the spelling of kleopatra/ cleopatra with a ""k""- it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection; 2) kleopatra's strength of character- essex's general characterization is appropriate and it's easy to see what kleopatra will become. although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex, it just didn't work for me. the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched. and although i loved kleopatra's love interest (i won't give away his name!), i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well, almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something. kleopatra's dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe, as was mohama. there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit... unnecessary. overall, although kleopatra was a strong, believable character, she was in the minority. the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt didn't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction! at least the sequel is better. for fiction that works, check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george.",1
"other reviewers have taken pains to outline the ""plot"" of this baby boomer bodice ripper. suffice it to say author kathryn harrison, scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that ""more is better"" , offers estrangement between identical twins, loss of a child, incest, paternity confusion, mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused new york shrink. this reader was aching for the hero, will, to book himself onto jerry springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from ms harrison like ""it's just...it's...what is it? will doesn't have a word for what he feels."" (perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader: the author, however, should not. in any case, those are lousy, lazy sentences among so many examples.)in addition to being insufferably, cartoonishly silly, the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure. bad things happen to will-the-shrink, will then regurgitates them at length to his shrink, then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened, what he thinks happened, and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks. as for ms harrsion's ""famous"" sex scenes. they practically lie on their backs, fondling their adverbs and panting for penthouse approval: ""she's unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly, almost unnaturally, slippery.""""envy"", by the way, is ms harrison's 11th book and she should, by now, be getting things more right than wrong",0
"this ""book"" is probably the worst written i've ever encountered. it was so flawed as to be considered literature. alice walker tries to ""one-up"" harriet beecher stowe, in writing about brutality. titles like these are weapons used in the anti-black male agenda this society has long perpetuated. all the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. the women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell. the only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. i've learned long ago, when absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at work. there are no ""real"" men in this book! only distorted caricatures of black masculinity. i only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. i find this title as dangerous as hitler's ""mien kampf"", in it's portrayal of black men as evil and morally destitute. presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. true, there are criminally abusive men in every culture. but there are also forthright, upstanding  men as well. to present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about. harriet beecher stowe's fictional ""uncle tom's cabin"", sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. this title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of black men. this book is fiction. however,it is not presented as such. i'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. i have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. however, i do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. that is what i find so unbelievable and offensive about this book. in my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. i don't find it a testament to the strength of black women at all. i interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of african-american culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the black male as being hopelessly inhuman.i'm sure alice walker made a lot of money with this book. feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. i wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades, were it a fictional depiction of white american men brutalizing white women. most definitely not!!! i doubt it would have even found a publisher. america is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of black men and african-american culture.my life as a black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion. whatever ms. walker's motivations were in writing this novel, i'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted. this is racist, misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature!",0
"herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the nazification of both germanies: did they side with israel in the middle east version of the cold war or did they not? the trial against paul merker in the east, which had as its background east germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things nazi in the gdr. but both of these arguments completely ignore the marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the east german leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. moreover, they totally eclipse the east german cultural discourse on the holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the west and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in western academia.",0
"eliot cohen has an impressive background in policy work (osd) and academia (naval war college and harvard).  i had high hopes for this book because i thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well-grounded work.  i was disappointed.  i never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals.  he seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold.  i could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way.   the article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal, but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts.  the lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work.  the churchill chapter was the best. cohen obviously has extensively studied churchill.  his sections on how the historical view of churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done, thought not rally tied to the focus of the book.  i learned the most from the ben-gurion, since i knew the least about him.  the book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy, but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest.",1

"when i first picked up drinking coffee elsewhere, i was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy.  and, truthfully, it's not a horrible book.  it is entertaining, the style works, etc.  on that note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much, then by all means, get it.  my problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of america, this is not your book.probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the african american female. packer has very little new to say, and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by alice walker and other writers, but have also have been said better by those authors.  drinking coffee elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of you can't keep a good woman down, a book that, while having its own problems, would probably be a better use of your time and money if you're really interested in the social commentary in the text.even from the literary standpoint, it's not terribly outstanding.  the characters are stereotypes; the plots are predictable.  the adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person-- an intelligent outsider who struggles with race, religion, and fitting in-- and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so.  the other protagonists are the same, just not so irritable.  similar to this lack of variation in her characters, packer varies little in her narrative style.  yes, the language is pretty at times, but there is no experimentation with language or structure; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice.  finally, the stories themselves contain scenes that aren't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative.in short, drinking coffee elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn't actual talent, but how much your publisher backs you.  packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs, which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out",1
"it's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  the majority of children of the mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  the characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  somehow, card even managed to make jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during pms.  the only decent characters in this book are miro and wang mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.i admit it: i only made it a little over half-way through children of the mind.  i couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  that's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of japanese and polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species.if you're that curious to learn how the ender quartet concludes, do what i should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage",0

this book (i believe) is one of lem's earlier stories and it reads like so-so pulp sci-fi. fiasco (a true 5 star science fiction novel) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better. i suggest reading this only if you are a lem completist (i've read all of his stuff except 2 books),1

"i will not lash out against anyone, and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious, ostentatious egotism. that said, let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth's solutions extremely difficult to accept. first off, it doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus's morals in general terms. if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us, then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus's codices. the key point here is that jesus's older analects were deluded enough. his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale. jesus's peuplade appears to be growing in number. i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations, circumvent any further litigation, and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death -- all by trumping up a phony emergency. his desire to control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind is the chief sign that he's a slaphappy caitiff. (the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo ""treatment"" to cure my ""problem"".) perhaps i'm reading too much into jesus's ravings, but they don't seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests. jesus's precis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent, noxious feudalism. that's pretty transparent. what's not so transparent is the answer to the following question: does jesus's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities? a clue might be that every time he tries, jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions. this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought, but for imagination as well. jesus's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity. and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing. (remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil?) jesus of nathareth has an agenda -- a political, social, and cultural agenda. and that's all i have to say.",0
"i have an amazon bookmark that advertises ludlum's book ""the sigma protocol"". it says ""in ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy."" well gee. that's the plot of this book as well. come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that i've read. a 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. they have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. this time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the middle east and far left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). enter ""ordinary man"" joel converse. he's a vietnam vet and p.o,w. who thought he had left that life far behind. it's up to him to save the world. he will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just have to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). he will find love, and he'll visit several european cities to boot. of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a nazi and an israeli are on the same side?), but ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. his dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. action scenes are generic. the only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this.

"paul ehrlich may understand butterflies more than most of us do, but he definitely does not understand how the real world in general and the human society in particular works. he just does not seem to have sufficiently organized brain cells to think realistically about the world.this book starts with the bold statement that ""he had understood the population explosion for quite some time"". nevertheless, the whole book proves that it's not the case. all his reasoning is based on the worst possible extrapolation of the worst imaginable short-term trend. his assumptions therefore include the ""intelligent"" assumption that there won't ever be any technological progress in the future; the climate will evolve in the worst possible way, and so forth. it's not surprising that he predicted that there would be mass starvation in the u.s. in the 1980s, and even when this was shown to be complete nonsense, he repeated the same prediction for the 1990s.why does he - and people like him - continue to produce predictions that have been humiliated so many times by the actual course of history? it's because of their religion. maybe they don't call it a ""religion"", but it is a religion nevertheless. jehovah's witnesses typically believe that there is going to be a judgement day. because it did not occur in 1918 and other years for which it was predicted, they are a bit more careful and vague in their predictions nowadays. malthus had done very similar errors as ehrlich, but you may think that in the 20th century, people could know more than malthus knew many years ago. but ehrlich does not know more.in some sense, even karl marx himself could be viewed as a producer of catastrophic predictions. marx predicted that something wrong would occur with capitalism as such, and it would be globally replaced by communism. (this is what i call a truly catastrophic prediction.) marx was wrong, of course, because he completely misunderstood the magic power of the society and of the market to improve things that need to be improved and its ability to self-regulate and accomodate to new conditions. ehrlich is repeating all errors of marx and many other errors, too.but other people who have a different kind of a religious belief that we must simply be approaching a judgement day can't learn from jehovah's witnesses mistakes. of course that paul ehrlich's reasoning has nothing to do with rational approach to important questions. (bjorn lomborg may be an example of a person who tries to solve very similar questions - namely these speculative questions about the long-term food problems - rationally.) ehrlich confuses the total amount of food available today and the total production of food; he does not understand that the efficiency of agriculture can increase much like the population or even more; he does not understand that the growth of the population in the developed world would be naturally reduced if it became difficult to feed children, and so forth. he just does not understand the ""invisible hand"" of free markets and the visible hand of scientific and technologica progress and the power of human decisions.his reasoning could easily be proved wrong if he simply tried to make similar predictions about the past. but it was not his main goal to find a realistic prediction for the future. his goal was to write down pseudorationally sounding justifications of his religious preconceptions that would impress many people who are not exactly smart.the similarity between ehrlich's predictions of mass starvation and the recent predictions of catastrophic global warming is not just a superficial coincidence. find the book ""boiling point"" by ross gelbspan at this website - one of the silly recent books about the climate change disasters that expect us. among the 15 mostly positive reviews of the book, you will also find a 5-star review by paul ehrlich of stanford himself! the global warming alarmists continue with the traditions of paul ehrlich. it is still the same pseudoscience and people will apparently always believe this kind of stuff because there are only two infinite things: the universe and human stupidity, and i am not sure about the universe",0

"i can see how instructors would be enthusiastic about this book, but unfortunately it will in no way help the student develop their ear training. here's the problem. the book and cd basically outlines a method of ear training, it is not ear training itself. for example, for each step of the book there is one and only one example on the cd. it is just that, an example, not a training. so, there is one 14 note ""lesson"" on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals. i don't think so. however, if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals. you could spend a month on variations of that lesson itself since that's the core of ear training. in fact, if you're an instructor you can use the whole book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing intervals to recognizing chords. by the way, the cd itself mostly uses really dull organ patches. the idea may have been to eliminate timbre as a distraction. however, since one of the goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone, this is another example of how this book/cd in itself won't be of much use to students.",0

"man, oh man, i think this is one of the worst books i've ever read.  if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars, i would!seriously, half way through, i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was.  boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive!i found the book bizarre, unfocused and poorly written.  the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused.  the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation.  the physics, engineering, psychology, medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic.  characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome, only to have them dissipate.  and so on.the characters don't even seem like real people.  for example, the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain, and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are.  how could someone know a person that well, but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood?  or:  one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them.  c'mon, if the guys a nut (and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck' to them is nuts!), write him as a nut the whole way through, don't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book's climax!the book's title isn't even explained, for crying out loud.  thanatos means death in greek, i believe, but i could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying.i won't read this one again, nor will i look for anything else by percy walker.",0

"from the cover and a quick glances at some of the colorful photo filled chapters, this book seem promising at first. but the cliched saying of never judge a book by its cover has taken its toll. this book provides marginal advice on how to -potentially- make a profit from the wonderful world of digital photography, however, it fails to give any real world working model on how this can be accomplished. most of the marginally useful advices and sales model, i.e. pricing structure on stock photos, are based on the author's own personal preference and experience, rather than taking into account the wide breadth of pricing methods that exist in the real world of photography.this is a great book for amateurs that are trying to break into the business of selling their prints from an outline or a strict table-of-content perspective of the available methods and channels of distribution to target, e.g. card stock, stock photo, art fairs, etc. most of topics cover seem to be more 'theoretical' than actual real-world hands down information and the author seems to expend more time, energy and care in expressing his disdain (with a condescending overtone, might i add) toward enthusiastic amateurs that aim to make it big and quick. his favorite recurring adjectives for such amateurs includes, but certainly are not limited to: prima donnas, pretentious, and pretend aficionado. heller may be a [self-aggrandizing] professional photographer, but anyone with such high caliber should be more helpful, than pompous or supercilious. remember heller, you were an amateur at one point too.further more, heller likes to take a seemingly interesting idea, get your hopes up and then tell you why you shouldn't pursue it because the odds are just too high against you.bottomline: if you are serious about licensing your photographs for use, then this book does not really cover the core foundations that you need to get your feet wet. on the otherhand, if you want to take a look at what you can do to -potentially- make a profit from your hobby, then this book basically gives you an -general- idea.i'd give this book a 1-star for the lack of usable information and the author's cockiness, but it does contain some interesting theories and sales model to warrant a 2-star rating",1

"i tend to like just about anything that brubaker writes.  while i'm not as excited about his marvel work as most others are, i have enjoyed his runs on captain america and daredevil.  his work outside of marvel has been great; sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years.  in general, brubaker had not written anything that i genuinely disliked.  then came 'deadly genesis'.in short, this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results.  to what end?  another summers brother who is completely disinteresting, another story in which professor x acts like a jerk, a dead x-men (for absolutely no good reason), and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years.i want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate.  unfortunately, this is the second instance in which brubaker has went back and altered marvel history from long ago.  in captain america, he made it so that bucky never really died in world war ii.  this initially rubbed me the wrong way, but the story itself was done well, and the surrounding plots were good, so i begrudgingly went along for the ride.  i was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book.his attempt to revise history doesn't work nearly as well here.  the key difference is that bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust.  he hadn't been written into any stories during all that time, so it was very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him.  in 'deadly genesis', brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago.  in order for them to work, the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward.  it just doesn't work.to make matters worse, none of the characters' motivation for anything makes any sense at all.  characters are keeping secrets, and other characters are upset with that, and through the whole you never understand why.  it's as if brubaker had an end goal in mind, and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point a to point b - even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story didn't make complete sense.that aside, another difference between the two is simply that this series is not written as well as captain america.  they overall plot doesn't make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly.  reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment.the interior art is nice, though not great.  unfortunately, the book falls so short on story alone that the art warrants almost no consideration",1

"wow! i read all these great reviews and thought this would be a great book. luckily, i got it out of the library & didn't buy it. i liked it at first, but then the situations got more & more implausible. then i was reading it just to laugh at it. some of the sentences in the book were completely ridiculous too. if i had the book here at work with me, maybe i could quote a couple descriptions that just had me rolling my eyes. not a well written book at all in my humble opinion. glad the rest of you enjoyed it anyway",1
"need i say more than the above title suggests? okay, so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience. there are some touching moments in this book, but even then there is still something the author is lacking. i saw the movie when it was in theatres and i have just finished reading the book. i liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book. the movie was funny, entertaining, touching, personal, and sad at times. the book did not captivate me at all. i had trouble staying focused. considering beverly donofrio's credentials--a bachelor's degree in english from wesleyan university and a master of fine arts in creative writing--her quality of writing is very poor. her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education, if even that. and not to go off topic, but since donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like columbia u, then why doesn't she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life? i mean, after all, the mfa is in creative writing, meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time. she has only wrote 2 books--riding in cars with boys, and looking for mary, both about her getting pregnant at a young age. if you liked the movie, just leave it at that. don't bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed. and if you're interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy, then go to the local library. don't get this one. there's other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one.",1
"this is one of the silliest books i have read for a long time. it could be categorised as belonging  to the same genre of ""action fantasy"" as a number of hollywood films.examples of the rules of reality being abandoned:the action takes place in the middle of antarctic winter, and the author even notes at one point how it's pitch dark outside, yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other.people spend minutes in freezing water, yet pop out none the worse for the wear.two close allies of the united states attack a us installation on no better motivation than a claim that a ""spaceship"" has been found there, shouted once through the radio.a 12-year-old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically, nor, apparently, mentally.a prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years, but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it.the stupidity goes on and on, but that's perhaps enough to give a taste. there are perhaps people who do not care about any of this, but i don't enjoy books whose author doesn't have one bit of interest in any sort of realism",1
"the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession. there is value in that. i look forward to reading part two, the liturgical ideas section. the emerging church is keen on praxis, but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom, which i had hoped we were past. here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book, which it might help to know:1. rollins does not think it's possible to really ""know"" much theology with ""certainty."" in fact, to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an ""idolatrous"" view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is. this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans, and because in his view, god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way.  the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views.he is very certain of his interpretations of ""perceptive thinkers like nietzsche, freud, and marx,"" eckhart, augustine, etc... and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct. i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really, really, faulty. as i'm reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament. so, be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible's basic content.  he is certain that no one should be certain, but him. ok, to be fair, he is not certain if christianity is true, and says so on page 44, but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity. nor, i guess, should you. with his view of ""critique of ideology"" how can he be so selective of what he is certain of. this seems like a self-defeating ideology. so strong is his disdain for ""knowing"" with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all. i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true, but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway. rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer, in my opinion. he says the church is not to be about giving answers, but helping raise in people: questioning. indeed, given his views, how could he provide answers? this book may look deep. i propose, it is merely muddy.2. he redefines age old terms. orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes, but how loosely one holds it. certainty of revealed truth is dangerous, misinformed, idolatrous. heresy is now a cute little thing. it has come of age. he says people will think his views undermine christianity. we are to just take him at his word that his views won't do so, but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would, i think, see the writing on the wall. 3. he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns. after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns, those like himself, at least, to even understand the gospel. he has not. how can he be a bridge? to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores. christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down, not without mystery, nor without debate, but in a very real and tangible way. he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else. 4. he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them. the problem that is huge, and no one seems to notice, is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps. he considers fundamentalists,and by logical extension many evangelicals, to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term, heresy. i kept thinking, what kind of ""fundamentalists"" is he so angry at? he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals, making generalizations that are misleading. very unobjective. unkind. very divisive. yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom. i can see his views bringing unity to all religions, but it will never bring unity to christendom. he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom. times have really changed in the past 20 years. he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind. 5. he makes god hopelessly difficult. god wanted, it seems, to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people, the dust of humanity, the lowly donkey ride, the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel. rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining ""human reason"" as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said ""i am the truth"" into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it. god's message is simple. it's clear where it needs to be. it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated. rollins makes it nearly all enigma, hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god, who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it, yet who has been unwilling or incapable, given man's weaknesses, or his own lack of communication skills, to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly.if, as tickle says, this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium, then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man's religion, the anything goes religion, and following generations will have to deconstruct today's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism. peter, i can learn some stuff from you, and i'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission. as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points. your views trouble me. nothing against you personally.  forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone. i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more, though, it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor. regardless, if it inspires i'll come back and add a star. hmmm",1
"i have read other books by alesia holliday and enjoyed them so i looked forward to reading this book.  unfortunately, i could not get any farther than the first 25 pages.  i even tried diving in further into the book to see if it got better and i still could not read more than 5 pages without turning away.  the best i can do to pin down why i dislike it so much is to say that it tries too hard.  no character seems to even approach reality.  they are all, including the main character and her love interest, over the top",1
"i only glanced through this book, yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied.i can, however, write about one of the editors, mike shaw, who made no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence' when assessing us as parents.he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london, england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an 'expert witness' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act. we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were ""at risk of neglect"". mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations. yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched. under cross examination, he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations.luckily for us, he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist.i don't know about his co-editors, but if his work is anything to go by, the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced.here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court.  judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously.evidence-gathering.""on 9.8.02, i interviewed mr & mrs orman [2 hours]""on 21.8.02, i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone [40 mins], witnessed contact [1 hour] and spoke to the children without their parents [20 mins] [and] i interviewed the foster carer [2 hours].observations.""mr & mrs orman were friendly and co-operative throughout.[...] mr orman showed insight [... but] wasn't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children. the couple were very robust in refuting the [welfare's] account, which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation.""contact took place in the park[...]the parents and children seemed happy to see each other; they chatted in animated style. [...] i wasn't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children's presence ""[interviewing the children] the children seemed attentive [...] but answered ""don't know"", fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions [...] erin related [a simpsons episode where] homer [...] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside. i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed. [note. this is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document!]conclusions & recommendations""[...] i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful. [...]""mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children. so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact. [...] i think there is some insecurity in the children's attachment to their parents. [note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park.]""were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own, i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs. [...] asked whether he had any regrets, mr orman didn't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care. [...] erin [who was 8 at the time] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper, and support and advise socially. i suspect mr orman would find this difficult.""my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness. [...] i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [sic] children. ""[...]the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed [sic] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home.""[...] returning home is likely to further retard the children's social and emotional development. [...]""these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse. [...] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause. i also find very plausible ms [charlotte] curran's suggestion (... [in] her [written] statement) that mr orman dominates his wife.""the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me, but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible. [..] i believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers. [...] contact should be gradually reduced.""mike shaw's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities, but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation. yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed, so that the children could lead a normal and happy life. he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70% of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents.our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt; and the case was eventually closed.so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions",0

"i first read this book back in the mid-80s after watching the miniseries starring gary cole as dr. jeffrey macdonald.  the miniseries absolutely riveted me, as did this book.  but upon repeated readings, i began to pick up inaccuracies and errors. i found that the book, rather than answering questions about this case, caused me to question more and more. joe mcginniss, while never a stellar writer to begin with, was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer, twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose, which was to sell his theory and therefore, his book.  i have nothing against mr. mcginniss forming his own opinion as to dr. macdonald's guilt or innocence, but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening.  if you want joe mcginniss' theory on how and why the murders happened, with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence, pick this book up.  if you want to read about the case, with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning dr. macdonald, do as other reviewers have suggested and read ""fatal justice"", a far more in-depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion.",0
"the venona secrets is a deceptive book. it tries to pass itself off as an objective portrait of soviet spying in the us, but by the time the reader is a third of the way in it becomes apparent that the authors are more interested in smearing ""liberals"" than in painting a true portrait of their subject. although the information the authors provide is interesting, the biased and heavy-handed way it's presented negates whatever scientific value it might have. for example, the authors insist that j. robert oppenheimer was working for the soviets (they call this a ""fact"") yet they present absolutely no proof that oppenheimer was anything more than an idealistic, naive man who couldn't keep his mouth shut and whose only contribution to the advancement of communism in america was money to the cpusa. the book is full of these so-called ""facts"" with little to nothing to back them up. the authors praise joe mccarthy and claim in the last chapter of the book that he was barely a factor in the anti-communist hysteria of the 1940's and 1950's, ignoring the fact that mccarthy capitalized on fears of communism obscenely and was wrong far more than he was right about who was and was not loyal. mccarthy's methods of terrorism and hypocrisy in running hearings that could have been chaired by stalin are completely overlooked, as are the innocent lives he destroyed in his smear campaign. the authors also praise senator henry jackson as some sort of all-american crusader against communism, not even mentioning that all of jackson's anti-communist attacks were motivated by his virulent anti-semistism and hatred of blacks. overall this book is nothing more than an indictment of liberal ideology -- one can simply hear the disdain for liberals dripping from the authors' prose -- and should not be given much credence by scholars not interested in right-wing propaganda who want an objective account of venona. the authors have sacrificed their credibility for their conservative agenda; they deserve not to be taken seriously",0
"sorry. i hate to pile on, but i must agree with lit teacher on this one. the thinking was sloppy and contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating. i bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until i could get around to it. i pulled it out today with a smile and high hopes.  boy was i disappointed. i thought maybe i was having a bad day. maybe my concentration was off. so i pulled out truman capote. smooth as silk. so it wasn't my fault. it was ron's. i finally decided to scan the book, and that revealed there was really nothing new here, nothing interesting. i wish i had not wasted the money. i must be more careful. but, as for this book, there is nothing i need to refer to later, so i'm putting it in the trash. it is saturday evening. they will come on monday to take it and the other garbage away. roger",0

"more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn't make that connection having read a few of faulkner's works.  sturgeon uses many of faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low iq individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but i didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying.i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  more than human is slow, dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others.  so the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, esp, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (asimov) and since.  this book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book (determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  besides more than human, the far superior the caves of steel, childhood's end, and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  needless to say, more than human did not win (farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)bottom line:  i wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  these are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests",1

"this book was given to me by my cousin who thought i might find faith after hearing the eulogy i gave at my father's funeral a year ago, in which i professed that i do not know if there is a god or not, but that the best we can do is be good people.i am agnostic, in that i am fully aware that there is no factual evidence that god exists and that there is no evidence that god does not exist. to be clear - if there was, i am pretty sure it would be widely publicized.the gift was a loving gesture and i am sincerely appreciative of it.however, i have several issues with the book. more than i can possibly iterate at this point.this book does not even mention agnosticism. as the author was educated at yale, i am sure he must be aware of agnosticism and chose to omit it from his book. i can only presume that it was omitted with a reason, perhaps it was too hard to explain in the face of his assertion that there is evidence for god (see below - all circumstantial and requiring leaps of faith).without getting into too many specifics, the evidence he uses in the case for faith comes from obviously christian sources - which are surely biased. this is equivalent to reporting on terrorist acts by only interviewing terrorists. certainly one's reporting would be validating reasons for such atrocities. to be clear i am only drawing this distinction to make the point - a true investigative reporter would look to include both sides of the story and present facts as opposed to opinion. had strobel intended to provide a balanced view, he would have used non-christian scientists and believers of various faiths.strobel's statements portend to be fact, but are generally lacking any actual evidence and in some cases are easily determined to be incorrect. a couple of examples are 1) his statement that buddhism says there is no god (various sects of buddhism believe in gods, state there is no creator god or do not take a stand on the matter) and 2) his statements on lack of evidence for evolution - specifically macroevolution (which is fairly well supported by actual evidence and observation - and believed to be accurate by 99% of biologists).  regarding evolution, there is actually evidence for macroevolution - although he claims there is none. this is where i have serious problems with the book. in my opinion, the book is more for current believers who need/desire to strengthen their faith, which i believe is a good thing. however, his information lacks factual support and evidence, which to me is a bad thing. i believe that most of the people who would read it would not get to the point of questioning the information in it. if one were to question it, one could easily find their faith destroyed if the information one held to be true (and which subsequently was the basis for faith) is found to be false. he states that there is evidence for intelligent design; however the evidence he offers is only theory in the colloquial sense - i.e. a guess. the theory of evolution is a theory in the scientific sense - i.e. supported by on observation and evidence.another example is when strobel quotes ""...when it comes right down to it, the only person or thing i know of worth my faith - the only one supported by the evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience - is jesus."" the buddha (meaning one who is awake), or   siddhartha gautama (his real name), was an actual person, supported by all of the above listed proof of jesus. mohammad was also an actual person supported by all of the above. his 3 reasons for disbelief in reincarnation (for regular people): 1) if james loses 3 pounds, he is still james, if he becomes a grasshopper he is not james - because he is not human2) support for past lives - such as memories, are explainable by psychological explanations, lucky guesses, or demonic possession3) the only expert on this question, jesus of nazareth, said it doesn't happen. to respond:1)	to believe in resurrection, one must believe that there is a substance which makes us who we are that is not tied to our earthly form. it is not tied to being human, but to existing.2)	how do you discount the possibility that reincarnation exists by asserting that demon possession exists - there is factual evidence for neither.3)	to be in line with this reason, one must already accept the divinity of jesus and that the resurrection actually happened. his arguments for the truth of the resurrection (below) are weak and offer no support for the fact, only that people claimed it happened. we should not confuse the fact that jesus existed with the belief that he was the son of god and specifically that he was reincarnated. here are his proof that god exists: 1)	god makes sense of the universe's origin2)	god makes sense of the universe's complexity3)	god makes sense of moral values (his argument is - if there are absolute moral values then god must exists god makes sense of the resurrection (see proof below).4)	god can be immediately experienced. to respond:1)	theories can be used to explain phenomenon that correlate to reality, but are not truly an explanation of reality. one still must take a leap of faith to believe his assertion. while it may explain questions about the universe - how do we know it to be accurate? put another way, there are other explanations that could wrap up the universe - additionally, one presumes he is speaking of the christian god and discounting other belief systems.2)	see my first objection. same point.3)	science believes in hard observable facts being the basis for making assertions. the basis of scientific fact is that it is able to be recreated by anyone. to take the leap from the fact that there are widely accepted truths to being proof of god requires faith. he gives examples of ideas that most of the civilized world thinks are wrong, and uses them as the basis for absolute moral values. he omits that moral values have changed over time and are evolving. while i do believe that things are wrong, one can easily recognize that they are not always absolute...for example, it is not ok to kill, unless you are in danger - or the other person killed others (presuming you believe in capital punishment).4)	his example here is that you cannot prove the world exists...fair enough, but one can prove there are universally experienced events that we can demonstrate over and over again. for example, we can do a physics experiment and everyone involved will see the same results (barring psychological conditions). while we may not be able to prove that the world exists, we can confirm common experience, which is essentially what the world is...the ground on which we all interact - whether or not that is created in the mind (the example he gives for how the world may not exist is that all of the world may only be in our mind).proof jesus was resurrected: 1)	the location of jesus' burial was widely known and agreed on.2)	the sunday after his crucifixion the tomb was empty, which is agreed upon by many (or all).3)	various groups of people experienced appearances of jesus alive again.4)	the original disciples suddenly and sincerely believe that jesus was risen from the dead - even enough to die for this belief.  to respond:1)	this is fact and jesus did exist. not sure how it relates to his divinity.2)	this could be explained in several ways, hard to use this as proof of his divinity. one can suppose it is, but it takes a leap of faith - this book is supposed to explain how to have faith - but continually requests we make leaps of faith.3)	writings of people who claims to experience jesus can hardly be taken as fact. other religious text would claim the same about their prophets, gods, etc. 4)	the disciples had a vested interest in proclaiming the divinity of jesus. this is not actual evidence. this is equivalent to stating that the bible is true because it says it is true.additionally, strobel chooses which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. in dealing with ""objection 5"" strobel notes that the descriptions of hell in the bible are metaphorical. it is hard to discern how someone can pick and choose which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. it is convenient to do so when your explanations support your understanding. i am not sure how you justify doing this. he states that only one religion can be right or god is schizophrenic. one supposes his assertion is that christianity is the one true religion or god is schizophrenic. this again is a leap of faith. one must also presume that the various religions are not human error in interpreting god's message.my stand is this, we do not know, and to have faith is great, however by creating a context in which one can have faith by providing erroneous and undeniably false/biased information, a false faith is created. faith should be born out of one's desire and belief system. one should not need to discount others because of their faith. to me, doing so indicates weakness in their faith - not strength.",1
"i've seen better high end audio books. i'm certainly not a member of the aforementioned ""scientific school of audio system performance analysis"", the only instruments that can accurately measure sound quality are the ones on either side of your head. i listen to what my ears tell me sounds good, and generally, tubes sound good. which is why this book is sort of a disappointment, you'd think that out of 80 projects there'd be at least one tube phono preamp, but unfortunately there are no tube amps, just a few rants about how tubes don't produce enough power. who uses more than a watt anyway? even the transistor amps presented aren't much better than what you could get from rex or circuit city, similar schematics could probably be found on the internet for free. go ahead and buy it if that's the sort of thing you're into, but if its tubes you want, try morgan jones' ""building valve amplifiers"", it doesn't have many schematics but it covers  in great detail the layout and contruction of tube amps. good schematics can be found on the intarnub",1

"i'm very disappointed in this book, although some information in it is valuable, it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover. it is an excellent textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular  basis and find ideas for what you need. although broken into sections, they  are not readily found or visible. one must search the information needed as  in a research assignment. the reproducibles are mainly for elementary  grades. this was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it's  contents, on-line. although the price was reasonable, i'm not pleased with  the way the book is organized &amp; printed",0
"i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican. funny. he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement. and let's face it: he stink bombed george h.w. bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton. i'm not saying bush would have won if walsh hadn't indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election, but walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for bush. bush got him back, of course, by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve, 1992.the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least. as it wore on, however, it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans. let's face it: people in power tend to be corrupt. they have protection the rest of us don't have. this wasn't just true about reagan and bush; it's true about clinton and whoever you wish to name. about halfway through the book, walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time, ghw bush.i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least. i guess when you can't beat a guy at the ballot box, you impeach him or at least try to.right?not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside.",1
"i grew up reading harold evan's sunday times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could. i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem; ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome (i'm irish) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland.  however, from today's perspective, the paper's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as `what would the world do without henry kissinger?' [indeed this has always seemed to be mr. kissinger's view also]; and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance, compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation.  my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan.  a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles (ss-20s?) being deployed in russian forests.  i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002/3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of saddam's mobile chemical/biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist.   	in saying all the above, i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch.  the book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made evan's sunday times great - the investigative reports from the insight team and others, of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry (thalidomide) and the aircraft industry (mcdonnell douglas); the publication of the crossman diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet.  having established his credentials  as a `vertical' journalist - evan's term, which he describes as `seeking to get to the bottom of things' - and lauding his proprietors, the thomson's, for allowing him to do so, the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr. murdoch as owner.  the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating, the thomson's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity, and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors.  murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times, having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of `national directors', guarantees, which if breached, were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction.  as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times - one of the free worlds most revered titles.   in his description of the paper, evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment - he sees it as the paper of record, upholding fair, non-partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect. one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people's educational background, almost every colleague is named and then his/her school and university are listed - for example joe smith, winchester, oxford, to establish both social class and academic (perhaps intellectual) credentials.  he documents the `four pillars' of the times as its reporting of parliament, its legal coverage, its obituaries and its leader columns.  oh dear! stolid stuff, from the fearless, vertical, investigative editor. nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which, by implication, criticise his predecessor as editor (william rees mogg); and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution.  looming behind this story is murdoch's general management style - haphazard interventions, secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning.  from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions, rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans. 	the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth - murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors. the text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone, save perhaps murdoch, evan's second-in-command betrays him, various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys, the `national directors' turn out to be paper tigers (this is too good a pun to delete), the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken, piecemeal.  the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero, valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious, double-dealing murdoch, whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval.   however, by the time i got to this section i had, sadly, lost a lot of respect for evan's impartiality, his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities.  this was reaffirmed in my mind when, on the day that evan's agreed to reign, who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger! 	in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor, initially at least, popular.   evans, though personally engaging - and i'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs. the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union.   the fading, indeed failing, social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly, given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides.  i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change.  the rest of the story - evans attractive forthrightness, murdoch's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story, are ultimately a side show.	this book is well told, highly dramatic and engaging, however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done.",1
"investment banker with a conscience, ben hartman, and special agent anna navaro's plot lines and bodies soon become intertwined in their quest for the secrets of sigma, an elite cabal with roots in nazi germany that is bent on world domination. what starts out as reasonable and entrancing enough genre pulp becomes sheer bond by the end, but there's no denying ludlum has a gift for keeping the heat turned up from page to page.if you are new to espionage fiction and have even slightly literary sensibilities, run don't walk to writers like alan furst, graham greene, or even john le carre. but if strong characters aren't a necessity, you are able to suspend your disbelief, and you are lusting for pure literary sugar, you probably won't be disappointed.ludlum is a great author for those who typically spend hours in front of the television and tremble in anticipation at the release of the next hollywood blockbuster, because he provides essentially the same experience in written form.  he is a master of the wildly oscillating plot line, but barely approaches apprentice status in any other literary area.  i found myself cringing in embarrassment for the author at many points, but to his credit i was compelled to continue turning the pages until i had reached the end.  it's like candy, you can't stop eating it but feel ill once it's gone.if you are a die hard ludlumite i admit this is my first foray.  please point me to a better example of his work if one exists, otherwise i'll invest my time elsewhere and catch up on mr. ludlum by proxy when the next ""bourne"" film comes out",1
"this book doesn't even deserve a star. i just fell upon it, on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house. i'm nearly 17 years old, and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older, but honestly, i don't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years... i've read so many reviews raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry i don't see it!anyone can write a bunch of sex stories. i didn't see anything poetic in the writing...it was plain. as for sensual and arousing? hardly. it was crude, and vulgar. it was sex, sex, sex... and presented harshly, with none of the sensuality, the sweetness, the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex... it was boring, repetitive, and i'll admit disturbing.what was the point of the story where the hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children? or the raped little boy? it was just weird. there's just the sex, and no development of any points she may be trying to make. it's kind of just left there...unfinished... unsatisfying. frankly, it was so distasteful (vulgar), i was shocked. and i'm not religious, puritan, conservative or any such thing...quite the opposite, i have an open mind. but this book left me cold",1
"this book was required reading for a class on children's literature.  so, naturally, i was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there.  the beginning was quite exceptional.  i even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening.  we were about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's female body parts.  due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children's literature.  we set the book down and did not finish it.  if you are looking for good children's literature that completely steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this book will be a let down.  sad, because up until that point, the writing was quite good.",1

"i must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with bill wyman's moans and boasts. his gripe with allan klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. mick and keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times?    bill opines that keith richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. listen to his only self-penned stones track of the 60s, on &quot;satanic majesties&quot;, and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior.     the book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take bill's accuracy on faith. my knowledge of the stones is not enormous, but even i can see some big factual errors. for example he tells us that neither taj mahal nor marianne faithfull recorded songs for the &quot;rock n roll circus&quot;. a recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong.      as another reviewer rightly said, marianne faithfull's autobiog is a much better read",0
"do you feel different from people around you?  do they resent your ingenuity?  have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs?  do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth?  congratulations!  you are either in the aryan nations or the clan of the cave bear fan club, possibly both!(i exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century english settler in australia, or a boer in south africa, or maybe you just like larry niven, but that's beside the point)i can forgive auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book.  in the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at wikipedia.  ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor.  i haven't read her more recent works, but i imagine she has probably improved.  even with the pendulous sentences clan is not unreadable.what infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged.  the story reads like a near-literal historicization of helena blavatsky's secret doctrine on the fall of the ""aryans""- who interbred with ""subhumans"" introducing the world to, oh i dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture.  of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression.  i would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give auel's books a wide berth.also?  enough rape scenes already",1

as a young woman i was appauled by gurian's lack of respect forwomen as human beings.what makes me the most furious is his shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the boys and men to take the lead in life.the resounding message isgirls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because of our hormones make important contributions to society beyond traditional roles.i don't remember ever being taken over by hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative chemical reactions he believes all females to be.i agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.gurianis a master at twisting words around and you have to read his books being mindfull of his tricks.his book is full of agenda.,1

"the first novel of laurell k. hamilton's merry gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. it's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things i've ever read. princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, andais, the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court. high profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of england. the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings. meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. i mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is, and what she looks like. meanwhile, princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. her fae red hair is now human red hair. her facial features remain the same. and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually princess meredith is....wait for it....merry gentry. jesus wept. and for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, ""hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith....merry gentry....princess meredith....oh my god, merry gentry is princess meredith!"" nope, she's just incognito, baby. at which point i almost threw down the book and said, ""you have got to be kidding me."" it's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. do laurell hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? given her past six or eight novels, including this one, i'm tempted to say: no, actually",0

"i really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great.  a shocking murder is committed in the town of newpointe, then another.  meanwhile, fireman mark branning has moved out and is separated from his wife allie.  there is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and allie and mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage.  i wanted to like this book because it is a christian novel with a good purpose.  ninety percent of the books i've read have been secular but i'm starting to read more christian novels.  but to me, this book fails for three reasons:  the marriage conflict between mark and allie isn't believable, the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight, and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing.		mark and allie's marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he hasn't convinced her otherwise.  seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery, but it is grounds for suspicion.  yet, allie assumes mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman.  it seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight.  instead, mark and allie separate and allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair.		blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between mark and allie.  throughout the book, references are made to allie believing mark had an affair with issie.  allie refers to mark's act as ""adultery"" and recalls him ""lying"" his way out of it after allie caught him hugging issie.  their marriage is struggling, but blackstock should have given more reasons why allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book, mark says he didn't have an affair and allie chalks it up to one of his lies.later in the novel, blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late.the serial killer story is poorly done, and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book.  when they book a suspect at the end, it seems ridiculous.  the police work feels like it was written by an amateur.  one line in the novel, ""as much as the evidence pointed to xxx, stan didn't want to believe it.""  in my opinion, the evidence didn't point to that person and stan, the detective, seems foolish for believing it.  there isn't any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story.  there is no sense of setting in the book.  there are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other.finally, this book talks about god and prayer and being ""saved"" throughout the book, and that's great.  with a serial killer on the loose, a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way.  at one point, a conversation goes like this:  ""how can the murder be part of god's plan?""  ""maybe it isn't""  ""that would mean god isn't in control.""  ""he is in control, but he allows some things to happen.""then at another point, mark says to allie, ""i'm going to be fine, it's time to trust the lord.  he's taken care of us so far.""then allie says:  ""but i don't know what his plan is.  i don't know how he wants this to end.  i don't know what he wants to teach us.""at other points in the book, characters say that god has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of god's plan and that through god's plan, all things can be used for good.  this line of logic is infuriating.  bad things happen to everyone, including god's people.  god doesn't ""allow"" a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife.  that's a horrible message to send to a non-christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck.  telling them it was part of god's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from god.god is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and god can even keep bad things from happening to christians.  but like above, where allie was afraid because she thought god might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson, god doesn't willfully kill people.  it comes down to the simple fact that all people, including serial killers and christians, have choices to make and have free will.i'm surprised i wrote so much on an 8 year old book but i wanted it to be a good book.",0

"melrose larry green's book is full of quotes.  quotes and information used to back up points are good things.  he appears to have researched by surfing the internet, watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others.  this is all fine and acceptable.the problem with ""why the clintons belong in prison"" is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative, which is sporadic, jumpy and poorly edited.  his points are not linear, and show the author's attention deficit.  with a proper literary team, this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a ""hit and run"" report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program.",1

"perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.  lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  as a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to ""sanitize"" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  one wearies quickly of the manichaean results.and like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.why, even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home's 1977 underground classic, ""a savage war of peace""!*  considering that home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot's, this is irony most profound.it is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot's espoused belief system.* recently reprinted and highly recommended!",0

"i have progressively become more and more disappointed with rita mae brown's books in the past decade. her early books were utterly magnificent; now, she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite (and by now, utterly boring) themes -- southern manners, horse bloodlines, and foxhunting. blessedly, ""whisker of evil"" was foxhunting-free, but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two. rita mae brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of virginia, and many of us have grace, manners, and respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that only virginians understand these things. that's just simply not true.that said, there were some delightful aspects of ""whisker of evil"" -- the mystery itself was great, the animal characters were adorable as ever, and i loved learning more about harry as a person and what makes her tick. her quitting the post office was a great (and very unexpected) twist. i liked reading more about her home and her relationships. however, the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of rita mae brown's fan base? it was so out of context in this book; certain details contributed to the horses' relationships to one another, but she took it way too far and i found myself skipping pages. as well, i almost threw the book across the room when i came across a line that stated in so many words that only virginians have manners. this is a common theme of ms. brown's and it is quite frankly offensive. there is a big, big world outside of virginia -- rita mae brown should know this, she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial, insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world. i would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it wasn't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade. enough already about southern manners (a biased perception at best), ancestor worship, bloodlines (human and horse), and foxhunting. whatever happened to characters like celeste chalfonte",1

"this is one of the worst-written programming books i have seen yet.  i'm sorry i bought it.  it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance, and dangerously little about c++ programming.  duffy's review correctly describes the main flaws.  i would add that (1) the book is not structured to build upon oo, gof patterns, or stl design principles; (2) the code does not follow even basic c++ coding conventions; (3) the images (screenshots) are agonizingly unreadable; (4) the code listings are in italics using a variable-pitch font [is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a $100 book???]; (5) no over-arching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book.some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers.  for example, pg 19 data types section:----------------int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million, for example, ""int i = 2000000;.""long - same as int.----------------wrong, professor!  this is not only a syntactically incorrect example, but a just plain wrong assertion.  if the reader does not know how to determine the (platform-specific) size of an ""int"" or ""long"", then the author has only served to confuse the matter further!furthermore, i consider it a ""cheapskate"" tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form (particularly when the book's code listings are so sloppy).  that said, i would not use the code, even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with...have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring?the only use i could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs, who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations (futures, forwards, etc) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code",0

"the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's cover. however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen. with just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria. "" i've made some cookies for tea, said ma"". the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma's.by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail. the final arrival for this story is grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home.  the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them. at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down. for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest. there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's grandma's cookies. there are roughly two to four sentences on each page. the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this",1
"the premise put forth in the title is supported by some keen insights into ""leadership by calling"" and comparisons to it with ""modern leadership theory.""  les csorba writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion; a point with which i agree. unfortunately, some of the examples he chooses are questionable...  after warning about the danger of weak character in powerful leaders, csorba chastises german chancellor schroeder for turning back on some promises to george w bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride him for his four wives.  meanwhile he praises jack welch for going from neutron jack to a gentler jack (which jack says he would abandon if needed)while still making the ""tough"" decisions that got the ""results"" for the shareholders.  jack can change is mind and go back to compassionless results... ok.  also, there is no mention that jack was getting results with his personal secretary whilst the wife was at home...  unfortunately the theme in csorba's examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of democrats and forgiving the sins of the republicans.  he does sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong-minded republicans in a meek attempt at balance.  it's a shame that he turned this into a politcally tainted work.  it started off so well.  it started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not people of faith as faith is central precept to this book.  it also started off well even though he chose to make george w bush the role model for how to be a trust-able leader.  unfortunately this conservative/political bent turned an even harder right from there and kept going.  it kept going to the point that i could no longer plan on sharing this book with some folks i know who really need it. they would simply say its a bush-ie/right-winger book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued premise.  too bad.  csorba almost had a classic instead of a politically tainted leadership manual.i say this even though i am republican, am one of the few folks who would admit they were voting for bush before the election, am a person of faith, and tend to find the dems an easy target.  but this book was supposed to be about so much more than republican politics.  too bad",0
"if we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the prague spring and street protests in the u.s., as kurlansky attempts in this book, the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year.  the reader is owed specifics, yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes.  prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent, but prohibited it.  chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government, however flawed, resulting from open debate.  a bigger difference could hardly be imagined.  but kurlansky does see striking differences, albeit only in the post-1968 world.  the soviet bloc began it's decent to oblivion, while the capitalist west avoided the same.  his disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean, though what manner of ""revolution"" he envisions is never rendered to specifics, likely for good reason.  but who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do",0

"i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti. i found the subject interesting, and the professor gave wonderful lectures. i had good expectations about this book going in, but those quickly soured as i read it.it seems correct, at least, about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock. not that such is a particularly daunting feet.however, it is rife with laughable fallacies. for instance, it calls david bowie, amongst other glam rock bands of the era, metal. it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock, when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all, such as the carpenters.i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore. bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap. further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book.i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs. for instance, it claims 'thunder rolls' by garth brooks is about domestic violence. its about infedility, not focusing on violence at all, but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on.the writing is also rather dry. many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence. it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band's successes or failures.after reading the book in completetion, i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues (50s to 60s) that i had thought were true. in the end, i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything",0
"i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women.  men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule.  the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level.  i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read ""discovering biblical equality.""  it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women",0

"i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years. i was born & raised in the north. i think evans should rename his book ""fiddler on the roof in the south"". his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here. it's very much: the southern jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were accepted, etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'yankee jews', like the instances when a few (yankee)rabbis in the south fought for civil rights. evans should realize that times have really changed here! the evangelical christians in my town (which is most people here) harrass me like crazy - 'i am praying for you!' 'have you read the words of jesus, who was a jew like you?' 'when will you come to my church'. blah, blah, blah. thank god for the minority of catholics, methodists, presbyterians and a few others who live here. they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am, and the way i will stay - a jew. i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience. jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences, and that they cannot relate to what i am saying.but i do want to ask evans a few questions:1) if things are so great for the jews in the south: why have you lived in new york for decades now???2) why don't you at least write either a new forward to the book, a magazine article, etc., contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time (for some of us at least), primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians?i read evans' books before i moved here, and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here. for a jew who really cares about her/his religion living here is depressing; it is practically jew-less; and, at best, the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me. (by the way, i am planning to move to a city!)by the way, don't bother writing to me to tell me that i am ""wrong"", or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church. believe me, with all the praying for me that is going on in this town, and all the myriad attempts to convert me, if it hasn't happened by now, as they say in these parts, it just ain't gonna happen",1
"what this is: an epic adventure. it would be imappropriate to review the wot series when speaking of the prophesies of the dragon book; it's also not really a supplement akin to, say, the monster manual for d&d--the only extra skills, feats, backgrounds, etc are those directly related to npcs in the campaign. what prophecies is designed to do is take a party of characters through their first six levels of adventuring, which correspond roughly to the first six books of the series of novels. the players are allowed to play a key behind the scenes role in the story of the novels and cameos have been scripted for many of the book's key characters. it's a really ambitious undertaking; players have to be given a compelling storyline, feel like they're making a difference in a campaign that covers over a year of game time, without letting them change what happens in the novels.does it work? i am currently gming this adventure. on paper, it looks really good. some of the scenes, especially in the later parts of the story, look exciting, moving even. faile's cameo is perfect, for example. in practice, though, it's been an extremely frustrating experience. first, the early encounters (as pointed out by another reviewer) are unnecessarily difficult and add nothing to the plot. as things progress, the authors presume too much on the goals and motivations of the players. there is one chapter, for example, where the introduction says something along the lines of, ""upon entering the city, the players will want to find (a certain npc) as soon as posible and will definitely want to investigate the actions of (another npc)."" the players in my campaign knew they wanted to talk to one of these guys eventually, but the other one was off their radar completely. throughout, i've had to improvise ways to keep them approximating the plot line of the campaign and by chapter 3, they're feeling very manipulated.the campaign assumes the party wants to do nothing more than hunt down dark friends and expose evil plots and will take great personal risk and go through great hardship (including, at one point, a monthlong trek through a winter wilderness without adequate provisions) on the chance of thwarting same. characters with any other motivations (say, a character modeled after mat or nynaeve in the books) will feel forced into situations unnaturally. there has been more than one point where one of the players saying, ""i *think* this is where the plot wants us to go.""so, in conclusion, while this adventure is excellent in its dreams and scope--and it's definitely better than something i could have designed myself--but it will fail often fail as a game. if you are intending to run a wot campaign, buy this adventure, read it so that you thoroughly understand its scope before you even let your players make up characters. the characters need to be created to fit the story or the story won't work",1

"more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn't make that connection having read a few of faulkner's works.  sturgeon uses many of faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low iq individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but i didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying.i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  more than human is slow, dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others.  so the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, esp, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (asimov) and since.  this book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book (determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  besides more than human, the far superior the caves of steel, childhood's end, and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  needless to say, more than human did not win (farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)bottom line:  i wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  these are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests",1

mark furman cab be a brilliant detective but he is not a medical examiner. this is the same guy who almost imediately solved the oj murder case while at the same time being shown to be a racist by his previous interview. one big plus and one big minus resulting in a not guilty verdict. mark has been shown to be a liability in anything involving ethics. he can add nothing to the terry schiavo story.,0

"'introducing postmodernism' is a good source to gather names of philosophers, architects, artists, anthropologists, linguists, and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to pm. the problem, and it is a big one, is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines. sure, if you only have half an hour to read up on pm, you can whip through this book and go on with your life. but if you're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon, and perhaps go on to read more, this book is not the place to start. check out david harvey's 'condition of postmodernism.' this will rip the top of your head clean off! it's much more weighty (in every sense of the word), but your understanding of pm will vastly improve, and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the 'genre'",1

"i clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for thinking that susan cooper's ""the dark is rising"" is plain awful. this book was recommended to harry potter fans who have run out of hp books to read. i must say it was a waste of my time to read ""dark.""never have i read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero. in this case, we are told that on his 11th birthday, an english boy named will stanton discovers he is the last of ""the old ones."" unlike jk rowling who, in the first pages of harry potter & the philosopher's (or sorcerer's) stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of harry as skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes, and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, cooper does not describe will stanton at all. the result is that the reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what will looks like!!i also find quite annoying cooper's approach to this good vs. evil tale. she is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are the old ones, and who or what exactly is the dark. as for the dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that the dark means cold, snow, and--of course--darkness. excuse me: but is this the best cooper can do? is this what this book is about?--the druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? what happened to the conception of evil as moral evil?",0

"never in my life have i been so outraged by what i have read as by the drivel spouted by dr. west in this book (in his translator's note), and by the use of `unponderingly' and ""the thinkery"" (among other things) in his translation of the clouds. i also read his translation of plato's apology of socrates, and found it grossly inferior to jowett.four texts on socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly: it should be hurled with great force. (apologies to dorothy parker.)not only are the translations themselves inexcusably inept, almost everything that he writes in his translator's note is wrong.the clouds is a play, not a scientific or mathematical treatise. as such, it has characters and dialogue. a `modern' translation of a play must be something that could be presented on a stage and make sense to a `modern' audience. if a character is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary, one does not make him spout drivel such as 'unponderingly'; one gives him a `shtick', which is a theatrical term. it's more or less a running gag associated with a particular character. you create, through clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words together, a characterization. he could be made to speak like a parody of william f. buckley or the star wars character yoda. as it stands, west's text cannot be presented as a play.it is neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as 'unponderingly'; indeed, it is inexcusable. it conveys neither humor nor cleverness. it comes off simply as stupid. the translator of a play must know something about theatre and drawing characters, which dr. west obviously does not. to state it bluntly: the translation of plays should be left to people who understand theatre and characterization, and who are creative. dr. west doesn't have a creative bone in his body.in regard to his translation of plato's the apology of socrates, the translation by dr. west is both original and good, but the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good. after all, when one has the work of such a brilliant predecessor as benjamin jowett to follow, the temptation to do something entirely different is strong. but it must be resisted. if dr. west had merely lightly revised jowett's great work, he would have made a contribution to learning. alas, he did neither. the version by jowett is clearly superior. here is a short excerpt:""and i must beg of you to grant me a favor: if i defend myself in my accustomed manner, and you hear me using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora, at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, i would ask you not to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this account. for i am more than seventy years of age, and appearing now for the first time in a court of law, i am quite a stranger to the language of the place; and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger, whom you would accuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the fashion of his country: am i making an unfair request of you? never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.""compare west's inept version:""...i do very much beg and beseech this of you: if you hear me speaking in my defense with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak both in the marketplace at the money-tables, where many of you have heard me, and elsewhere, do not wonder or make a disturbance because of this. for this is how it is: now is the first time i have come before a law court, at the age of seventy; hence i am simply foreign to the manner of speech here. so just as, if i really did happen to be a foreigner, you would surely sympathize with me if i spoke in the dialect and way in which i was raised, so also i do beg of you now (and it is just, at least, as it seems to me): leave aside the manner of my speech--for perhaps it may be worse, but perhaps better--and instead consider this very thing and apply your mind to this: whether the things i say are just or not. for this is the virtue of a judge, while that of an orator is to speak the truth.""""speaking...with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak""? how utterly inept and repetitive! didn't he even proof-read? one doesn't speak with 'speeches', one speaks with words!it is obvious that dr. west never read his version aloud as a test of its appropriateness, which is surprising, because this work is supposed to be a speech. dr. west's version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud, whereas jowett's is. in west's translation, socrates is a clumsy, repetitive, and inept speaker. needlessly so. if you want to read a good translation, see jowett's 3rd edition (1892).why does dr. west believe himself qualified to make translations? nothing in his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so. this is not the work of a scholar, but that of a bungling hack. these translations are travesties. how does work this nauseatingly bad get published?not recommende",1
"let's make this clear... i won't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself. so this is going to be short and sweet!  this book is a glorified magazine.  worth $14.95 - tops.  the pitfalls of bookbuying online, i guess.  you never know what you are going to get.  anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared.  the text portion, however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared.  the uninitiated might even be led to believe that kodak and konica are the only game in town in infrared films.  throughout the book the author treats these two as the &quot;coke and pepsi&quot; of infrared films.  i'm going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same",1

"by chance before picking this up i had just finished the heart is a lonely hunter by carson mccullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. it's a great ""compare and contrast"" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. heart published in 1940, and castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s. both families are poor. in castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. this is supposedly because they ""don't know how to do anything"". so instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. how charming! they are ""eccentric"", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. only stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. but he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum topaz--striking poses.unlike the looming and grinding poverty of heart then, the poverty in the castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. not so in america where mick kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.in castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. two dashing young wealthy americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. they throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant american style. most of the remainder of the novel consists of cassandra and her sister rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being. it's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. if your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!the reviews for this novel in amazon are overwhelmingly positive. smith was obviously talented. her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. i wish she had given cassandra a little more ambition.",1
"the author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to oj's guilt. [there was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge!] you won't learn anything new from this book. it has a long list of books on the subject, but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them. were they all equal in quality? the oj case received more publicity than the oklahoma city bombing or the clinton impeachment. the national association of editors and publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news. could it have been intended as a distraction from other news? in may 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how north korea was ready to attack and start a war; this was repeated weekly. in 1999 i read that president carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to north korea (must have been a success, since the propaganda stopped). could the double murders in brentwood have been well-publicized as a distraction? isn't two murders a day the usual la statistics? how many other waiters (just from mezzaluna) were murdered each year? are murders by organized crime often solved?the book ""killing time"" noted that restaurants and health clubs (in la and elsewhere) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution. if this explains the murders, you won't find much in this book.

"after reading the trilogy, i was left wondering what the hell happened? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.   pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. there isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. if you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. from first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just mia for the entire book. spoilers ahead.  what about lyra and her parents? somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. over a cup of tea, naturally. and that's it for him.in addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. what happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  and what happened to the `temptation'? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with. as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other. the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!  pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. in addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. all of will and lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons. after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. iorek byrnison, lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun. pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter!  this is not children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. it's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one. we never get closure on lyra's parents.we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from.we never see will reunited with his mother.we get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how.lyra and will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it.the mulefa and mary malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. presumably, will goes home, although we never see it. all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing.the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. it all just sort of disovles.mary forgot to be the serpent, or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.another reader pointed out:"" phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. what a waste of time. i can't believe this book actually won awards. it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."" it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime. absurd.this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.",0

"i was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment.  one would think that a 'scholar' such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the hebraic roots of judeo-christianity.  it was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known messianic signs spoken of in the gospels.  he is also clueless to the pharisidical judaism of the time..not comprehending that all of christ's teachings were completely in keeping with true judaism. all of which can be found in contemporary rabbinical teachings of his time. this book, which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels.  like it or not..the new testament writings are hebraic and explain what fulfilled judaism is.  those who need to divorce judaism from christianity are offering a church which is already confused, just more confusion. it is through studying the hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our lord; 'fullfillment of the law', binding and loosing (the law)..etc as well as the parables.  the delivering of the deaf mute..was a messianic sign, because the rabbi's knew that 'they' had to ask the said demon its name but he did not.  lazerus's resurrection was a messianic sign because the rabbi's believed that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days after death.  cleansing of a leper was  messainic sign because the rabbi's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment, that only god could lift. how else can we link isa 53 with the 'stripes' he was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the law required for transgression, and yet 'minus one'. had our lord transgressed the law, then the jews themselves could have legally killed him.  remember paul (saul)?  he also does not understand john and his huge part in the whole picture, in that the kingdom 'began' with john.  he was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in prophecy.  this is hebraic roots 101.  people, please study the hebraic roots of christianity and do not waste your time with this book. the fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not' anti-semetic, should give you a clue",0

"susanna rowson's &quot;charlotte temple&quot; is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. poor, pitiful charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin.          rowson encases her heroine charlotte temple within a world of virtue and vengeance. charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman. she has no real interest in charlotte as a dimensional character. charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings.           &quot;charlotte temple&quot; was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed america. a morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now &quot;charlotte temple&quot; has been rediscovered and published in a scholarly press edition.          was this reclamation of charlotte really necessary? in the past twenty years, feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati. authors such as anne plumptre, frances burney, aphra behn, sarah fielding and charlotte lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives. feminist scholar cathy davidson has taken charlotte temple in hand and aims to join rowson to the above list of rediscoveries.          unfortunately, rowson does not warrant such treatment. rowson has a flat, humorless approach to the fallen woman story. unlike burney's &quot;evelina&quot; or &quot;camilla,&quot; rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity.  her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates.           in many of the fallen women stories, authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures. rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel. she seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in england and america, it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel, so rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed.          rowson does not criticize men within the novel. she does not censure montraville for taking charlotte as his mistress, impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman. when he believes that charlotte has becomes his best friend's mistress, he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him.          he aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting &quot;dishonorable&quot; against her. yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her, she would not have been reduced to a penniless, pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter. he never takes responsibility for his role in charlotte's downfall.  rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with montraville but she fails to take it.           instead, rowson places the blame for charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. when charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family, she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men.          madame du pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose miss la rue. madame du pont sets charlotte's downfall in action. rowson does not punish the ignorant madame du pont by killing her, she ends up an hysterical mess after the montraville/charlotte &quot;elopement.&quot;          miss la rue, the woman who pushes charlotte into the arms of montraville, must be punished for being a promiscuous woman. she ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food. she ends up dying painfully as rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women.          why would modern readers want to read this? i do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. at 125 pages, it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. no character has any shadings. there are no subplots to divert the attention from the static charlotte. rowson does nothing to keep our interest.          unfortunately rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first american woman to have a best-selling novel. that accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia, but it does not make for engaging reading",0
"i read this book for a book report, and because i could not choose another one i could not stop reading it. because i was forced to read this book i now have the knoledge and misfortune of this pathetically boring story. the steriotypical characters hurried through the story full of excuses. 1 star for one very boring book",0
"i purchased this book at walmart, which rarely carries books regarding shambala or any other eastern ideology. it was cheap and on the clearance rack. i should have know better.when i realized this was part three in a series i decided to read the first two books, the celestine prophecy and the tenth insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one. after borrowing and reading the first two, i realized what a sham this series truly is. first, i realize they are supposed to be fictional. however, when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise, the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate. additionally, when usurping a mythical name such as shambala, one should know what the actual mythology entails, instead of making up one's own notion of what is involed.  shambala is not the same as shangri-la. shangri-la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century western culture. shambala is an ancient eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in redfield's imagination.also, beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies. as joseph campbell said many times in his lectures and books, they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures, but they must never be mixed together. it just doesn't work",1
"i have several dummies books, from how to build a pc to ccna.  i had to read this rediculous book when i worked for a very well known dsl provider on the east coast.  this book was trivial, assumes that you are completely mindless and plugs certain products and services shamelessly.  yes, i agree, hot bot is a pretty good search engine...but it is not the only one out there.  this book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement.  easily the worst dummies book in print, and im not being a jerk, i love dummies books, ron gilster rocks, but this is absolute crap.  you can honestly get more informed with a magazine",1
"although a majority of readers obviously loves this book, i have to say that it really seemed like a waste of money to me. our only daughter left for college this year, but fortunately i have trained her in time to be independent. if your kid doesn't have a clue how to live in the real world and if if you're still willing to do everything for them and not have them take responsibilities for their own lives, this book is right for you. not in my dreams would i have made lists for her what to take because she can well do this herself! i do miss her and she misses us but that does not mean clinging dependency! i expected different things from this book, on a deeper psychological level",0

"i have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market.  edain mccoy, who has written some wonderful new age material, strikes an off-putting note in this one.  the spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation, but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements.  in several of her spreads she conveys that a card's placement at a certain point in the spread ""may or may not"" mean some karmic element at play.  the whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define.  therefore, when a card ""may or may not"" mean something, that interpretation could significantly change on whether you ""may or may not"" interpret it that way, leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning.  tarot cards are intuitive, not rational, and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity   it is difficult to have it both ways and i found working with these spreads difficult.  imagine doing a celtic cross reading and the first position ""may or may not"" be the root of the issue.  these spreads speak very clearly to the author, but not so to the reader.  i rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into karma and past lives, but the explanations are too ambiguous.",1
"blind items has the same writing style as at least one of rettenmund's other books (boy culture).  he goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs.  kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the sunday magazine section of your newspaper.  if you like this writing style, rettenmund's books may be for you.  personally it drove me crazy and i set the book down after the first few chapters",0

"normally i like the entire ""female power"" thing but frankly the ""this is wrong"" or ""evil"" part of that storyline is really old.  in an era where girls do try out for and get placed on ""boys"" teams, these issues seem outdated.  likewise rules were recently changed in indiana (not even slightly a liberal state) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex or gender.  i know, this book is from 1999, but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening, changes are happening.  overall i felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different.  even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her ""magic"" is empowered through a pageant and her cooking.  how much more gender role enforcement can we have?  really, with a strong female lead, shouldn't a buffy universe story do better than this?  in general the feel of the relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but not particularly outstanding",0
"while i think the basics of the book are good, i don't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option.  i did much better on the south beach diet, where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods.  fat is what makes us feel satisfied.  after years of trying to diet by limiting fat, it was a revelation to me i could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived.  an omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary.  secondly, many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat.  i just noticed this week that cool whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it's top ingredients.  this can't be better for you than actual cream.  i also prefer the book ""french woman don't get fat"", which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good, natural food when it's in season.  the pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle.  i feel that the g.i diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before.  i think this book is  about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated.  it certainly can help get people on the right track, but i think there are better books available.",1
"i loved the first carole matthews novel i read, ""for better or worse"", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. it kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because i didnt' have anything else to do. i am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.  i totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. there were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. to me, matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. i think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage. if you want to read something good, pick up a jane green novel instead.",1
"i purchased this book several months ago. during that time i've tried several of the recipes - the french lentil soup is very good. the chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing. the chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste. the recipe for mushroom, french lentil and chestnut ragu says to ""see glossary"" for the chestnuts but there's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts. it wasn't until i read another recipe (smoky chestnut and sweet potato soup) that chestnuts were discussed. the mediterranean salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster. far too much red onion (which my guests mostly picked out). although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare. as someone who works full time, a 20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure, no matter how good it sounds. i had trouble finding some of the ingredients. for example, the author specifies several different types of squash which i haven't been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer's markets.  the book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents. if you're looking for a specific recipe you'll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient. the author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop",1

"i have enjoyed many of mark's novels (do you know that i love you is my favorite of the bunch), all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer.  every character in every roeder novel speaks with the same voice--all of them, and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters, his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older.  there is frequent repetition and redudancy; characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times (though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel ancient prejudice, which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide).  his characters always (and i mean always) mate for life, which is a beautiful romantic ideal, but ultimately can get tiresome (gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment).  all that said, at his best (dykwik, a better life, keeper of secrets) mark roeder writes a compelling and often un-put-downable story.  but in outfield menace, the bad most definitely outweighs the good.  did mr. roeder do any research into the time period???  the fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel (if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens, who don't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time), but if you want to set a novel in the fifties, don't have a lead male character with a ponytail.  no one, but no one, wore a pony tail in the fifties (and certainly not in a small midwest town).  don't have characters use anachronisms like ""fifteen minutes of fame.""  and most of all, don't have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys.mark roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing.  he has apparently made a name for himself (and some money i'd guess), and i must confess, i've bought his novels (glutton for coming out stories that i am) but no legitimate house would publish his novels, at least not without major editing and rewriting, something that a self published author (especially one with an apparently inflated self image) goes without.  there has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two.  major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as totally joe, m or f?, the hookup artist, rainbow road, boy girl boy.  read them, if only to see how these truly outstanding (and published by legit houses) novels could teach mark roeder a thing or two.  if you must read roeder, then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep.  memo to roeder: if you want to write about a time you don't know about, do your research",1
"this is where ordering a book through the internet is a little disappointing, as you can't browse the book before purchasing it.  &quot;camping activities for kids&quot; is very light on the  &quot;activities.&quot;  it does a good job of laying out items that should  be brought along on ones first camping trip, but falls short on suggesting  outdoor activities for kids.  the activities that are suggested are a  little simplistic.  for example, &quot;laying sticks apart from one another  and pretending it's a river, and then have the kids jump over it and  playing golf with sticks and using pine cones as balls.&quot;  i was hoping  for more endepth activities.  if it's your first time camping this books  okay, but if you've camped for awhile and your kids are a little older the  book falls short so look for something else",1

"after reading the trilogy, i was left wondering what the hell happened? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.   pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. there isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. if you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. from first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just mia for the entire book. spoilers ahead.  what about lyra and her parents? somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. over a cup of tea, naturally. and that's it for him.in addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. what happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  and what happened to the `temptation'? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with. as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other. the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!  pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. in addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. all of will and lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons. after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. iorek byrnison, lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun. pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter!  this is not children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. it's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one. we never get closure on lyra's parents.we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from.we never see will reunited with his mother.we get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how.lyra and will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it.the mulefa and mary malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. presumably, will goes home, although we never see it. all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing.the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. it all just sort of disovles.mary forgot to be the serpent, or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.another reader pointed out:"" phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. what a waste of time. i can't believe this book actually won awards. it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."" it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime. absurd.this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.",0
"while the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive.  what i think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics.  an example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter, but doesn't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together.  he just tells you that you need to tie them together.  what if you don't have a shoelace to use?  what other alternates are there?  this book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire, but it's not enough for the serious camper",1

"i am an elementary school teacher previewing this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for a study of religion. i am not religious and i strive to take a learner's stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that i present to my students. betsy and guilio maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics; books that i have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without bias. this particular work unfortunately is neither. their gesture was genuine and gracious, an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote. no deity need take offense; all were included in the pantheon of possibilities. it is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors.though written as an overview of many of the world religions, this book culminates in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious pluralism, the view that no religion is objectively truer than any other. one point ought to be obvious, though: everything can't be true. the religions mentioned are like oil and water; they can't mix because they represent opposite and competing concepts. an appeal to their similarities doesn't help. we would never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because they both come in tablet form. it's the differences that are critical. that's true in all areas of life, especially the spiritual.if god exists, he's either personal or not personal. he can't be both. if god is merely a cosmic energy, why ask his blessing? he can't hear or respond. if he's a person, then he's someone, not everyone.this book is not as much a story of religions as it is a recipe for religious stew",1
"&quot;our attention is the most precious resource we have,&quot; says shenk. well...i'm not sure everyone would agree.  but this is the way he would like to slice the whole matter of information technology, the media,  etc., etc., and that's fine.  shenk's standpoint is amazingly isolated and  will make sense only to an elite ensconced in the same high fallutin' mix  of punditry/technology/leisure time he is.  information overload, or  &quot;data smog&quot; as the author terms it, is certainly a relevant and  important area to explore, but shenk, in is privileged world, really can't  nail down what might be so detrimental about it.  his examples illustrate  just how removed his is from the vast majority of american society:  minute-by-minute news reports diluting the quality of info and the ability  to sort it, not feeling so apt to respond to your friends' email because  you get too much, the end of patience? as he represents it in &quot;the end  of patience,&quot; data smog really ain't no big woop--it's just some tacks  on the erogomic seats of a pampered minority into which shenk seems to fit.   where's the politics, i wonder?  how does this trivia fit into the lives  of middle americans or working people?  to the point, shenk might benefit  from a step or two away from his computer.  rubbing shoulders with the  common folk might hip him to serious problems like acne or monday night  football",1

"some photographers think what's erotic is what's hidden and left to the imagination. two thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing, leaving plenty to the imagination. think of playboy magazine in the 1950's or vogue or madamoselle magazine today.  many of these are stylistic, but not very erotic.  one in three of the photos in the book are erotic, not afraid of nudity. don't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism. instead get ""shaven angels"", ""natural beauties"", ""100 naked girls"", or ""crazy,sexy girls"".",1
"i was extremely disappointed with ""after midnight"".  the author, his widow, has written the book from her own life's perspective, and there is sadly little about the true brad davis.  his homosexuality, or perhaps bisexuality, is mentioned only in passing, and anyone in new york or hollywood that knew him will tell you that this was a huge part of his life.  i guess a book written by his wife can't be expected to delve too deeply into this area, but even other interesting details - his drug addiction, his acting technique, etc. are only minimally suggested here.  i wanted to put the book down after two chapters, but kept waiting for it to get interesting.  i suggest the publishers retitle the book ""my life with brad davis - the saga of a wife kept in the dark"", or something similar, to indicate to readers that this book is about susan bluestein, and tells very little about brad",1

"i typically do not read stories like this, but a neighbor had lent it to me and i figured i'd check it out.  the plot isn't bad, but the dialogue is another story.  the writing was so unbelievably awful that i had to fight myself to finish it.  phrases like ""god damn, oh god, etc..."" were repeated over and over again. i got really sick hearing about tess's cute freckles and jimmy's movie star looks/sex drive.  the majority of the story line between tess and jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand.  it was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing.  i'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book. not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from harlequin romances...",1
"i had high expectations for this book, but i was disappointed.  it concentrated too much on digital systems, rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment.  i lost interested in the last 1/3 of the book, and couldn't wait to finish",0
"this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths, and underlying the story are indeed echoes, sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted, of ancient myths.  god is allegorized as gabalawi, the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs.  the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters.  the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel; the second that of moses and pharaoh; the third that of jesus; the fourth that of muhammad.  then there is a fifth story, in which the central figure, a `magician',  is presumably a scientist.  he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi  he fails to find it, but in the process he is  instrumental in the death of gabalawi `who had been easier to kill than to see'. it makes no difference: the scientist, who has invented a weapon of great destructive power, is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer, and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever, though they remain hopeful that one day `magic' will put an end to their suffering.subtle the book is not, either in content or in style; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive.  the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names, but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another.  a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent.  they mostly `shout', `scream', `shriek', `yell', `cry' or `sneer', which becomes rather tiresome. the literary quality of this novel is, i think, greatly inferior to mahfouz's rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature.  but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written: it has been banned in egypt;  its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author's life.",0

"i am absolutely furious about this book. i quit reading about half-way through.i read it through the section about it's a wonderful life (chapter 13). in that chapter, i found three mistakes - not minor details, but major, provable points, including misquoting zuzu and misquoting the inscription in the book in the last scene - within four paragraphs. if eliot's work is that shoddy in four paragraphs, how can i trust the rest of the information in the book? avoid this at all costs!!!!!!!!!",1

"whether you're planning to read through crowley's book of thoth for the first time, or if you think you know every little thing crowley was getting at with it, this book is going to be equally useless to you. several of crowley's diagrams from the book of thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly, but sadly that's the only good thing about this book. the book is filled with a lot of fluff. duquette tells many useless anecdotes of crowley's and harris' lives, and constantly excuses and defends crowley's character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper. duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found crowley's works, so perhaps its some sort of atonement. but the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with crowley's character.through out the book of thoth crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems. having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid. unfortunately duquette doesn't do this. his background information is base and scarce. he does spend some time explaining about thelema and kabbalah, but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this, duquette doesn't give nearly enough information to understand crowley's works, and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere.as for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on crowley's work, duquette outright fails. at times it seems as if duquette doesn't even understand crowley or the book of thoth and the associated tarot deck. i don't think the man even understands tarot in general (and duquette's own tarot deck is evidence of this too). at his best, duquette only manages to rephrase what crowley had to say in the book of thoth. typically though a lot of what crowley was getting at is complete lost in duquette's work, a lot of it no doubt because duquette never really understood crowley at anything but a very base level.reading through the book of thoth, there are a few ways in which duquette could have made his book better. crowley's phonetic translation of the i ching doesn't follow the current standard, and sometimes the differences are confusing, especially if the reader is not already familiar with the i ching. a key showing crowley's translation and the standard translation would've been helpful. likewise crowley rarely wrote on astrology, despite astrology being alluded to many times through the book of thoth, and what he did write is hard to find. a chapter explaining crowley's views on astrology would've been great. if that wasn't possible, then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what crowley was working with would have been helpful. however duquette's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read.duquette's book isn't useful as a reference to crowley's work. duquette doesn't seem to understand crowley most of the time, and fails to adequatley explain crowley's ideas. besides some new-agey nonsense, like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays, duquette doesn't offer any new ideas or insights into crowley's work. except for a few nice diagrams (which are common enough and easy to find), there isn't anything worthwhile contained in this book. at least not anything you won't get out of reading crowley's book of thoth",1
well  after i received the book i have to say i was quite disappointed because i am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books .after i read the reviews i thought i was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables .it turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures .if you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed dont buy it.the other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented,1
"this book provides excellent information about what rheumatoid arthritis is, how to distinguish it from osteoarthritis, etc.however, i don't want to live with ra, i want to recover from it. as such, this book offers no help in this regard. it tells me about drugs that i can take and splints that i can wear to help me from becoming completely disabled, but offers me no hope of recovery.in contrast, the book ""conquering arthritis"" by barbara allan, is the well-researched account of someone who took charge of their health and fought to recover from the disease, to get their life back. and succeeded! i'm well on the road to recovery myself by applying the principles in her book. now that's a book well worth spending your money on",1
"i really didn't enjoy this book.  i am half italian-american, and i've read a few books about growing up in an italian-american family in an effort to learn about my roots.  i have also read several books about 2nd generation americans struggling to find their identities while caught between what is &quot;normal&quot; and their immigrant parents.  i normally enjoy such books, but not this one.  i know that life wasn't always a bowl of cherries for these familes, but this book makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible.  yet, i couldn't find anything about the daughters' lives that are really that bad or even different from many people's lives in this country.  where is all the anger coming from?  i really don't know.  this book is dark and depressing.  some say it is funny at times, but i didn't think so.  i couldn't even bring myself to finish it",0

"i was barely able to finish this book. armstrong makes fun of vampires and witches, etc. by dragging in all the cheesy pop culture references she can think of. this made it very hard for me to take her characters seriously. i might have been able to swallow the idea of cabals (giant glitzy corporations run by sorcerors; it's unclear why they don't just take over the world and have done), but armstrong really lost me during the 20-page extended send-up of anne rice's vampires. this genre is rapidly sinking into self-referentialism, and armstrong is the worst culprit. in industrial magic, she ruins what could have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is. on top of that, the viewpoint character, paige, is unfortunately named: she's as flat and boring as the pages she's written on. her central relationship is with her boyfriend, lucas, but their coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors. are we supposed to think this is cute and funny? take-home project for armstrong: next time, try putting some genuine emotion into your work",1
"""the burning"" was a big letdown after reading bentley little's masterful book, ""dispatch"".  i seriously considered that this book might be written by someone else while bentley was ill and couldn't write.  who knows.  i love this guy and can't tell you how disappointed i was.  while one of the top 5 horror writers working today, bentley little seems to be hit or miss with his stories.  i simply just did not enjoy reading this new release.  it seemed that he was throwing way too much random horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick.  and, with everything he was trying to do, none of it - not one moment - was scary!  shadow creatures performing random oral sex, creeping fungus, talking voices in the microwave, deformed goblins peering in windows, skeletons climbing out of mud pits, tunnels filled with moving corpses, and a runaway ghost train crashing into the white house was just too silly.  it reminded me of his previous work, ""the return"", another disappointment containing silly, bizarre, and unrealistic situations.    the scenes of horror during the first third of the book were described during the daytime hours and lost its scare value, suspense, and atmospheric quality.  the book had many problems that pulled me out of the story.  one of those problems was how ridiculous it was that the police would allow a field trip to a tunnel of bodies that had just been discovered earlier that same day. bentley needs to do what he does best, which is to come up with a gimmick, focus everything on that single idea, and continue to build suspense around it using his original and obsessed style of storytelling.  it worked with ""the store"", ""the association"", ""the policy"", and ""dispatch"", just to name a few.  let's hope he gets back on track with his next book.",0

bought these for my nikon d200 about 3 months ago. never having used tiffen before i took a chance on a recommendation. vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse i've seen. build quality of all the filters is really not very good. going to go back to hoya's which are much better,0

"i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. i'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i've had these problems from the gitgo:-i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. very interestingly, if the section right above the one i'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless!-the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly.again, it might have been a defective unit, but i thought i'd point my observations out anyway. i wanted to buy this from amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $40+, so i went elsewhere and got it for $30.",0
"polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some ""pop"" out of clouds. there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs. for instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system, circular polarizers are designed to work with those features. linear polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. unless you are certain, just get a circular polarizing filter. there are some digital circular polarizers on the market. i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  what ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  if you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.currently i use the hoya pro1 filters, as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. the weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  when it came down to the images, at times i would see a browning tint on my photos. the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2, but i don't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter.overall, i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters.  i originally thought, ""it is canon, it must be quality.""  since then i have replaced all my canon filters.  this filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.pros: can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons: bulky and heavynot neutral color balance",1
"as a professional photographer, i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. my equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit!)the cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months",0
"i am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  two have broken.  as other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the ""female"" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black ""spring"" cover over the screws on the shoe.  you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  canon should do this at the factory.i use this cord with a stroboframe ""portrait/landscape"" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.  unfortunately, i do not believe that there are alternative cords. it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords",0
"i have been using this cord for about a year, and i had problems with its durability.  it actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  when mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  i had to buy a replacement part from canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  i flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  i wrote to canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. so far, there is no response.  a few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ettl to ttl mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  i checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ettl mode.  for a piece of equipment from canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. it's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  as there are no other oem manufacturers of this cord, i am forced to get another one and hope for the best.",0
beware of  assuming that  the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct  size.  it wasn't even close.  no size was given for the lense diameter. i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping & all the hassel of  packaging it,1
i agree with the previous review.  the deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out,0
"this kit is just junk. the &quot;deluxe blower brush&quot; is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. there is a &quot;tweezers&quot; that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. the &quot;lintless cleaning cloth&quot; is an about 3&quot; x 5&quot; piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. this kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges",0
"polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some ""pop"" out of clouds. there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs. for instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system, circular polarizers are designed to work with those features. linear polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. unless you are certain, just get a circular polarizing filter. there are some digital circular polarizers on the market. i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  what ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  if you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.currently i use the hoya pro1 filters, as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. the weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  when it came down to the images, at times i would see a browning tint on my photos. the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2, but i don't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter.overall, i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters.  i originally thought, ""it is canon, it must be quality.""  since then i have replaced all my canon filters.  this filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.pros: can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons: bulky and heavynot neutral color balance",1
"i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera. i only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. i think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro.",1
"for nearly $100, this adaptor provides very little (1.5x) magnification.  it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly.  this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor, which is used infrequently by me, but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance.  it is lightweight, but cumbersome and doesn't accept filters.  for real telephoto capabilities, get an slr with interchangeable lenses.  i sent this product back.",0
description or product is wrong.  there is no quad independent power/charging indicators.  they are set up in banks of two.  one light for two charging bays. batteries must be charged in banks of two.  tried e-mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger. e-mail came back as undeliverable.  cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger,0
"the documentation is terrible. its going to take a lot of practice. if you're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine. however i want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x sb600s.just setting the d200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the sb800/masster & sb600s it's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail, in the manual.the sb800 is designed for this purpose. so why not include information on how to do this?",0
"i bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my rebel xt.  amazingly, i find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit.  i find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless i correct the exposure using the menu.  would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430ex are better, but i cannot recommend this one",1
"i was expecting much more from this flash, i already started looking for the better one. if i knew this was a closeout item i'd never buy it. it died on me with no indication, sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it. now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries...save money and buy 5xx series flash..",0
"at 300mm this lens is very soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  to do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. of course, the high iso then introduces other artifacts.  the focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  this is a lens that i have constantly fought with.  don't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either, as it's only marginally better.buy the 70-200 f/4l.  it's a far superior lens",0
"this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  i sent the camera for warranty service (i had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. they claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: i was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.i had another a410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service (so i suppose it was no loss after all).  obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.    in short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. if you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which i'm not doing) soon.",0
"this camera is incredibly frustrating.  i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  however, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  and forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  if it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  since i take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  if you want to do any natural light photography, forget it.",1
"i bought this lens for my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find.  i knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but, was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens.  i liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization.  i shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed.  the pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull.  i thought it might have been my new camera at first because i couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad.  i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i had for my canon film slr and the results were much better.  for the digital focal length though, my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor.later, i decided on the tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews.  the salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when i told him i had this canon lens.  he said, ""let me guess, you'd like to try the tamron 17-50/2.8.""  he said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. i could return it with no questions asked if i wasn't satisfied.  he also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet.  my first images with this lens were great.  they were sharp and had way more vibrant color.  there is absolutely no comparison at all.  i was hesitant to buy a third party lens but, my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results.  this is the first review i have ever posted on amazon.  i was so dissapointed that i wanted to help others not make the same mistake.  after spending $$$ on a digital slr, it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens.  before taking a chance on buying the canon, do yourself a big favor and try the canon and tamron at a local store.",1
"i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  also, at the end of a pan the head tends to ""unwind,"" causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  thus, i think it's rather misleading to label this as a ""photo / video"" tripod.  additionally, i don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.instead of video, i'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.if you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  you'll love it, i guarantee that.that's why i give this one 2 stars",1
"looks nice. unfortunately did not power up the camera, so i can't say much else. going to cost me return shipping at the very least. sorry i didn't buy the canon product instead",0

"i purchased this camera in august 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is november 2006. kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired. is that right?it takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time. you try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message. i have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives. i now have to go to my local photo place to get a cd and prints made and then download them into my easyshare software. oh, shouldn't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera.also, i had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock. when i put the camera on the dock, it doesn't charge the battery or print pictures, the screen just goes grey. this camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me. the cost of shipping, cd's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me.kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email. what are they afraid of, they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers.do not purchase this camera, it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera",1
"i only wish i could return this camera. its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants (what i do most) and its manual focus is difficult (very difficult) to use. my much cheaper, and lower resolution, old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions. i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus. in addition, photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card.don't buy this camera",0
"this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture.  furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like hoya s-hmc or b+w mrc filters.  as for polarizer effect itself, i think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day.

"i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. you truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a digital rebel xt). incredibly soft. even stopped down, i would never want to make an enlargement from it. stay away. don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. you're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the l version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. you're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. having switched from nikon when switching to digital, i almost judged canon from this one lens, which i'm glad i didn't. don't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did. this lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses:canon 10-22mmcanon 28-105mm (3.5 version)canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-l version) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it. the kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when i could afford it, i sold it too. you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75-300mm lens.",1
the minute i took the monopod out of cover it broke. the mounting head fell apart from the leg. the glue they use is very bad. i didn't return the product because i think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords. i just fixed it myself,0
"""you get what you pay for""most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  the philips dvp642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  this is not.i was hoping the same of this product from all the ""glowing"" reviews on here.  however, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  first of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  for myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    however, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  this monopod doesn't even come close.here are it's bad points:-the aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  the leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  it feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time.-the head is very cheap and not solid.  no matter how tight i tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  the workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  i think we've all experienced that in the past.-the leg locks are not tight.  when you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves.in the end, it was a risk i took hoping that i could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  sometimes, you can get away with that.  walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  in this case, i should've bought a real monopod.  oh well, i wasted $16 that i could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod",1
"last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was ""refurbished"" by canon it worked perfectly. i bought also a new battery and a 48mb compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for ""refurbished"" items is less than 6 months",1
"i was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 is in this case) i expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate. -positives-fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.the bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.that's about it.-negatives-the polycarbonate is so thin i half expect it to be translucent.the hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.its very long.  especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  that's pretty conspicuous.it's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).i traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak",1

"ok, i imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but i am going to say it anyway.  this little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  you need a wireless router!!  so rather than just complain, let me tell you what i want canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution! with cf cards in the 12gb range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (i know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16mp that shoot in jpeg & raw on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.what i want is a bluetooth compact flash card. they make these so i know it is possible.  i would like canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that i can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  now that would make it so that when i am in the studio or shooting a wedding, i have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and i don't have to drag along a wireless router and i saved myself $700.  get to it canon - i am waiting!!!",1
"i got this for my s70. first off, in order to use it, you have to set the s70 to ""radio control"" (about 9 button pushes). then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized. if you need a ""cable release,"" i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera. it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings, and you're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time.",1
"i have just bought the sony cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and i have only taken 30-40 pictures, i loved it and then it just stopped working, so i recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. so thankfully i had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. no it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. basically worthless. it seems like it might have short circuited. but i was so excitted to buy this camera i read all instructions before use, i haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. so i am going to try to return it or exchange it. i am hoping to get good service or i will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures. hopefully i can let you know if they stand by their products. before now i have always been happy with what i have bought from amazo",1

"the camera worked fine; however, after six months, it stopped working.  i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism.  my use was in no way abusive.  i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage, until i gave it away.  i guess i should have stayed with canon.  i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight, but what good is that if it doesn't last!  don't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it",0
"yes, i have to agree with the previous review.  it doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  it doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  if it was less expensive i wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  but that seems to be all it's good for",1

"i bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but i've been disappointed. previous to this i bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. i need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. i shoot with a 20d.the usm is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens i choose to buy in place of this one. the focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good",0

"like most people i got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image.  i've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment.  sure enough: * the shutter cover has often stuck open or shut. * sometimes it refuses to start at all. * it sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera. * finally, the lcd stopped working altogether.  this is after 8 months.casio has decided i'm not under warranty (no explanation as to why, no phone number to argue with them), and is charging me $97 to repair it.don't be seduced! it's a poor quality product",0
"just for the record, my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier casio models. presently in iraq, i do want to have a camera with me, but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service. sad. it looked to be a great camera",0
"i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years.   i love everything canon does.  however i do not understand canon's reasoning behind producing this lens.the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the ""film"" plane.  they cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens.they have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro.as i said, if for $60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on all canon cameras, i'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all.granted, you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon, but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr's, so why bother with this lens?the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me.my $0.0",1
"after reading the many good reviews here, i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera.  i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem.  this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  i could view previously taken pictures (lcd ok) but any new photo i tried to take was black. i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  so, was it the lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day?  i can't say for sure, but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the lcd since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots).",1
"i have had this camera since jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings. don't expect much from it and you will be happy. as an entry level dslr it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. i find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving. cons:in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.battery dies fast. the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in raw mode. i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode(approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. surprisingly when shooting jpegs, i get more shots per charge(over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike. so i always carry a backup film camera (my trusty elan 7).the viewfinder is very dim. when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d's viewfinder. in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus. autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. when shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.the 420ex flash is supposed to ""talk"" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. however, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. after about five months, the shutter button started sticking. i would click it and then it would remain depressed. the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little.another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. and since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. for example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.so would i recommend this camera:if you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos. but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere",0
"hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, i have a problem with my camera and i don't have anyone to help, i've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where i can ask for some help, i don't really understand why is this site so well known on &quot;customer service&quot;, but i just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, i'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the &quot;help area&quot;. i need to repair my lcd monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all",1
"i received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. i was shocked, i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this.",1
"when i opened the package, i found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. i thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. when i opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. while it's bad sign, i still thought it's ok as long as i could put them together. well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (i never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). before to ship it back, i did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! i couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from amazon, not from some unknowns of ebay (actually, any ebayer will have to worry about the feedback). i was really shocked that amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!hope this is just a random incident and amazon does have a very easy return practice. otherwise, i would not buy anything from amazon",1

"i have known canon to be a very high quality company. however, i was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations i had about this camera. a few years ago i bought the fujiffilm 3800. i loved this camera but after a few ski trips i found it rather bulky. i then bought the canon s500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the s400. for most of the pictures i take on a ski trip this camera is fine. however, if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime, this camera is worse than a disposable camera. first, there is no red-eye reduction. it simply does not work when i set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. second, pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. i would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. third, night picture?....forget about it. i tried to get a beatiful picture of the chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. so, i tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and i could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. looks like i'll be back in the market for a fujifilm. after all the reviews i've read, i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (e18, lcd, etc.). not to mention the terrible service that i have been reading about",0
"after just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read ""e18"".  so i was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that canon refuses to admit.  try googling canon s500 e18"", and you'll see what i meant.don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight",0

"i purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last march. i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support. they went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. well i followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. so they said i should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. then i sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. they sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. well i just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. they never fixed the problem. mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. i called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. she said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. well i was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late august a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. she said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. i told i have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before i sent it in the first time. i started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when i got off the phone. the camera is worse than a disposable camera. don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. i recommend olympus. my olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. i am planning on contacting the better business bureau regarding this matter. please don't waste your time on this, like i have to! i hope this helps people make better choices! good luck! i wish someone could have forecasted this for me",1
"after owning three other canon cameras i am through with canon. all my other cameras were fine. this cameras lcd broke within the first month of normal use. never dropped! all of my other digital cameras held up for years. ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen. never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times.this is a product defect/design flaw and canon will not cover it under warranty. $150.00 to get it repaired and it will happen again, or you may start getting the e18 errors. this is a expensive paperweight!poor design. very dissapointed. i will never buy another canon product again",0
"for average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. i don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. so, i don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. it was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good",1
"i have owned several canon digital cameras and like them very much.  i purchased the a520 as a gift for a family member.  after several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  it would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  the key word being stick or stuck.  i took it to a canon service center and they repaired it under warranty.  after trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  i took it back to the service center and they repaired it again.  while looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  it was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  after emailing canon they said to just email them if i have a problem and they would see what they could do.  very poor.  i like canon digital cameras but wish i had never purchased the a520.  i bought it because of it's low price, which was a big mistake",0
"this is my third digital camera, i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports.after a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it.  i would manually open up the lens cover each time.  then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that.   but now the camera is almost completely dead.  it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  i'm not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this.i will not buy another canon camera.  this camera was made too cheaply.  i wish things were not made to break right away",0

"these are my experiences with the extender mounted to my eos 10d. i'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30d, but it looks like i don't want to risk wasting my money. let me explain:let me start by saying that the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the lcd screen. i shoot events at nightclubs a lot, so i'm always (a) running around to get shots, causing me to sweat, which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and (b) i always show the subjects their photos after i take them, so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying. for further clarification, i'm asian, so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities.i run around a lot when i shoot. so the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off. i got lucky once, and found it in the general vicinity of where i was, but the second time, i wasn't so lucky. so what did i do? i purchased another one. not only did i have to purchase the extender, i had to purchase the viewfinder replacement (the piece with the soft rubber) because that was attached to the lost extender. another 2 weeks in, and again, same problem. i didn't even bother buying any replacements, as by this time, i upgraded to the 30d.if you don't plan on doing a lot of running around, then this piece may be okay for you. however, please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my canon backpack. for some reason, the piece didn't fit tightly with the mount on the camera.another problem, as most people mentioned, is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender, so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day.i guess i'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30d; i'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10d",0
"ok, maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose doesn't smudge the lcd screen as much.  the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera.  both my 30d and rebel xt.  if i am lucky enough it will fall off, get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory",1
"i wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as i can to help keep the shot stable (i shoot birds at 700mm). the first thing my friend and i did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. in other words - completely useless",1
"yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), but there is a major problem with this.  the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses.",0
the frame and the pictures it displays are fine.  sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my pc.  my major complaint is the power supply.  the original power supply dies after 4 months.  it was repalced under warranty (after some grief with customer service).  the raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired.  i then had to buy one.  that one died after a few months and the company didn't have the replacement in stock.  after months of waiting from them to stock the item i gave up and after lots of searching on the web i found a supply made by another compay.  i had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame.  it's been doing fine since then.  i should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems.  it looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now.  i would do a lot of shopping before buying this one,0

"it looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. like a brand named leather wallet. but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  there is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). there is no way to clip to the belt. will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. bought another handy synthetic case afterwards",1
"this filter is fine for normal shooting, but if you do low-light work, beware; you will see bad internal reflections on night shots, and will need to remove the filter",0
"i bought this camera in february, and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died, i could review the photos i had taken, but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the lcd/efv, and only turned off when i removed batteries, i sent it to fuji repair center, and got it back again almost one month later. then six months later the camera did exactly same thing, i haven't received my camera back yet, but i'm sure never will buy a fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after i get from the repair center and at the end of the day i will have wasted almost 500 dlls",0

i purchased a 510 powershot in summer of 2005. after couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work anymore. i cound't take any picture anymore. i contacted canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix.,0
"i admit that i'm far from an expert on digital cameras. i did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.i purchased a 510 powershot in july of 2005. it wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them. i can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, but once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (i also emailed them the same request). neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon's behalf.that in itself was enough for me and i've been bitter about that ever since. i've also told every person that i've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. i'm pleased to say, i've steered most away from this company.what else can i say about this camera:this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. i've missed out on some good shots due to this.it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa's to even make this camera worth its while.i've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are very white. almost like looking at an infra red photograph.when filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. like i said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?i wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion. think about that. you have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still under warranty. that's disgusting, that's all i have to say.there should be a zero for this, not a 1 star",1
i agree with m. arse with the 2star rating. i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. i'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers. i've read that it has much better shutter speed. recommended??,0
"i have owned this camera for about a year and i have never really enjoyed it.  for a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and i often miss out on a good shot.  it is also not as user friendly as i would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  while i enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  i have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but i rarely get a good picture when i need it.  i never had these problems with my elph s200.  this camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. if given the option i would not buy this camera again",1
"hello all,lens hoods are pretty much a necessity, but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i've ever used. unlike other hoods that screw on, this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one, and release the clips. this leads to problems of alignment, meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right. although it's a pain and i hate...i don't really have another alternative. either go w/o a hood, or take this one. either way, guess i'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one",1
"wow... now if you really want to see a rip-off, here it is. not to be damaging to amazon.com but hey for the 50mm just get some carboard and tape it to the front to shield it from the sun. the hood is definitely not worth it",1
"it's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs -- this hood.  how can you pay $75 for a great prime lens, and $25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it",1

"this camera will probably go down in nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january 2003. from the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  i also bought the sb800s (3 of them), thinking the cls would be a great addition. but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.the camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. but the results are disappointing. the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (canon) offers. nikon finally realized this and on dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. it just so happened mine was in melville, n.y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. these include bad af performance since upgrading to v2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value.i would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers. indeed, forget nikon and go to canon",0

"polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some ""pop"" out of clouds. there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs. for instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system, circular polarizers are designed to work with those features. linear polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. unless you are certain, just get a circular polarizing filter. there are some digital circular polarizers on the market. i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  what ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  if you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.currently i use the hoya pro1 filters, as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. the weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  when it came down to the images, at times i would see a browning tint on my photos. the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2, but i don't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter.overall, i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters.  i originally thought, ""it is canon, it must be quality.""  since then i have replaced all my canon filters.  this filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.pros: can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons: bulky and heavynot neutral color balance",1

"at 300mm this lens is very soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  to do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. of course, the high iso then introduces other artifacts.  the focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  this is a lens that i have constantly fought with.  don't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either, as it's only marginally better.buy the 70-200 f/4l.  it's a far superior lens",0
"this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  i sent the camera for warranty service (i had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. they claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: i was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.i had another a410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service (so i suppose it was no loss after all).  obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.    in short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. if you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which i'm not doing) soon.",0
"this camera is incredibly frustrating.  i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  however, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  and forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  if it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  since i take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  if you want to do any natural light photography, forget it.",1
"i bought this lens for my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find.  i knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but, was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens.  i liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization.  i shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed.  the pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull.  i thought it might have been my new camera at first because i couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad.  i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i had for my canon film slr and the results were much better.  for the digital focal length though, my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor.later, i decided on the tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews.  the salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when i told him i had this canon lens.  he said, ""let me guess, you'd like to try the tamron 17-50/2.8.""  he said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. i could return it with no questions asked if i wasn't satisfied.  he also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet.  my first images with this lens were great.  they were sharp and had way more vibrant color.  there is absolutely no comparison at all.  i was hesitant to buy a third party lens but, my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results.  this is the first review i have ever posted on amazon.  i was so dissapointed that i wanted to help others not make the same mistake.  after spending $$$ on a digital slr, it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens.  before taking a chance on buying the canon, do yourself a big favor and try the canon and tamron at a local store.",1
"i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  also, at the end of a pan the head tends to ""unwind,"" causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  thus, i think it's rather misleading to label this as a ""photo / video"" tripod.  additionally, i don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.instead of video, i'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.if you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  you'll love it, i guarantee that.that's why i give this one 2 stars",1
"looks nice. unfortunately did not power up the camera, so i can't say much else. going to cost me return shipping at the very least. sorry i didn't buy the canon product instead",0
they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one..........don't think so since i got copy.......poor customer service all around.....,0
"i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. i'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i've had these problems from the gitgo:-i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. very interestingly, if the section right above the one i'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless!-the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly.again, it might have been a defective unit, but i thought i'd point my observations out anyway. i wanted to buy this from amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $40+, so i went elsewhere and got it for $30.",0

"this kit is just junk. the &quot;deluxe blower brush&quot; is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. there is a &quot;tweezers&quot; that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. the &quot;lintless cleaning cloth&quot; is an about 3&quot; x 5&quot; piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. this kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges",0
"i purchased this camera in august 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is november 2006. kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired. is that right?it takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time. you try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message. i have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives. i now have to go to my local photo place to get a cd and prints made and then download them into my easyshare software. oh, shouldn't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera.also, i had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock. when i put the camera on the dock, it doesn't charge the battery or print pictures, the screen just goes grey. this camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me. the cost of shipping, cd's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me.kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email. what are they afraid of, they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers.do not purchase this camera, it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera",1
"i only wish i could return this camera. its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants (what i do most) and its manual focus is difficult (very difficult) to use. my much cheaper, and lower resolution, old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions. i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus. in addition, photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card.don't buy this camera",0
"this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture.  furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like hoya s-hmc or b+w mrc filters.  as for polarizer effect itself, i think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day.

"i purchased the 75-300mm for a trip to a nascar nextel cup championship in homestead, fl. i was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning. the lens is not very sharp, feels very cheap, and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light. i packed up and returned the lens about an hour after i got off the plane. i am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture. i suggest you do the same.",1
"i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. you truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a digital rebel xt). incredibly soft. even stopped down, i would never want to make an enlargement from it. stay away. don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. you're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the l version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. you're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. having switched from nikon when switching to digital, i almost judged canon from this one lens, which i'm glad i didn't. don't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did. this lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses:canon 10-22mmcanon 28-105mm (3.5 version)canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-l version) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it. the kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when i could afford it, i sold it too. you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75-300mm lens.",1
the minute i took the monopod out of cover it broke. the mounting head fell apart from the leg. the glue they use is very bad. i didn't return the product because i think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords. i just fixed it myself,0
"""you get what you pay for""most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  the philips dvp642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  this is not.i was hoping the same of this product from all the ""glowing"" reviews on here.  however, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  first of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  for myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    however, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  this monopod doesn't even come close.here are it's bad points:-the aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  the leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  it feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time.-the head is very cheap and not solid.  no matter how tight i tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  the workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  i think we've all experienced that in the past.-the leg locks are not tight.  when you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves.in the end, it was a risk i took hoping that i could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  sometimes, you can get away with that.  walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  in this case, i should've bought a real monopod.  oh well, i wasted $16 that i could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod",1
"last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was ""refurbished"" by canon it worked perfectly. i bought also a new battery and a 48mb compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for ""refurbished"" items is less than 6 months",1
"i was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 is in this case) i expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate. -positives-fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.the bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.that's about it.-negatives-the polycarbonate is so thin i half expect it to be translucent.the hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.its very long.  especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  that's pretty conspicuous.it's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).i traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak",1

"ok, i imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but i am going to say it anyway.  this little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  you need a wireless router!!  so rather than just complain, let me tell you what i want canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution! with cf cards in the 12gb range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (i know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16mp that shoot in jpeg & raw on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.what i want is a bluetooth compact flash card. they make these so i know it is possible.  i would like canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that i can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  now that would make it so that when i am in the studio or shooting a wedding, i have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and i don't have to drag along a wireless router and i saved myself $700.  get to it canon - i am waiting!!!",1
"i got this for my s70. first off, in order to use it, you have to set the s70 to ""radio control"" (about 9 button pushes). then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized. if you need a ""cable release,"" i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera. it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings, and you're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time.",1
"i have just bought the sony cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and i have only taken 30-40 pictures, i loved it and then it just stopped working, so i recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. so thankfully i had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. no it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. basically worthless. it seems like it might have short circuited. but i was so excitted to buy this camera i read all instructions before use, i haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. so i am going to try to return it or exchange it. i am hoping to get good service or i will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures. hopefully i can let you know if they stand by their products. before now i have always been happy with what i have bought from amazo",1

"i am not impressed with tiffen filters i got in this set.  the finish of the rings are poor.  despite of previously poor reputaion, i recently purchased some 67mm quantaray filter from the local ritz camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of tiffen filters.  i never got tiffens before, had good experience with hoyas.  i will probably stay with those from now on.  now come to think of it, ritz camera indicated the quantaray they had were made by hoya.  the glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the hoyas and the quantarays.  not a good sign.the circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  quite frustrating.  all of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters i got before had this kind of problem right out of the box.the set might be cheap, but it sure is for a good reason",0
"the filters that i got are poorly finished.  the 812 filter has a smudge on it, while all 3 filters don't screw on properly on my lens.  all filters come off easily.  they are totally useless.  i suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens",0

"polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some ""pop"" out of clouds. there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs. for instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price. if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system, circular polarizers are designed to work with those features. linear polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. unless you are certain, just get a circular polarizing filter. there are some digital circular polarizers on the market. i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. what ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. if you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings. currently i use the hoya pro1 filters, as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. the weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. when it came down to the images, at times i would see a browning tint on my photos. the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2, but i don't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter. overall, i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters. i originally thought, ""it is canon, it must be quality."" since then i have replaced all my canon filters. this filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters. pros: can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons: bulky and heavy not neutral color balance",1

"the camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. this camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and i did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  i bought a sony pda and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the lcd. of course, sony said it was my fault and that i must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that pda - after 1 month? since the camera was out of warranty, i knew there was nothing they were going to do. so if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! but if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. i used to be a great financial supporter of sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. i am not buying anymore sony products - i have lost the love for sony and their products! beware!canon, here i come!",1

"don't buy this camera really.  i had it for a month and was taking good care of it.  i was initially thrilled.  the lcd screen got damaged -- no i didn't drop it.  the treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that i was shocked. the customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if i were an idiot.  a $181 repair bill for a $300 camera is not feasible.  it was a great camera at first, but i demand better treatment and respect from the company.  look for a better camera, look on the web for comments on their customer service and don't buy this camera.  i had read very negative things about sony but didn't think they applied -- they really are true.  i don't like being called a liar by anyone especially when i am the customer.  the camera is a month old and it is now garbage.  while i understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty, i will not accept such poor treatment and customer service.  i teach photography and will tell my students the same thing -- if customer service and respect matter to you, then do not buy this camera.",0
"the camera worked fine; however, after six months, it stopped working.  i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism.  my use was in no way abusive.  i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage, until i gave it away.  i guess i should have stayed with canon.  i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight, but what good is that if it doesn't last!  don't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it",0
"yes, i have to agree with the previous review.  it doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  it doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  if it was less expensive i wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  but that seems to be all it's good for",1

"i bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but i've been disappointed. previous to this i bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. i need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. i shoot with a 20d.the usm is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens i choose to buy in place of this one. the focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good",0
well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version... wrong!i just received mine today and it's got the international warranty card and users manual. i haven't decided if i'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey-market version of this unit,1
"from reading the other reviews, i seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my a530.  within a month after buying it, the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on.  i have to manually flick open the shutter/cover.  then, the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction (that is, it works to ""zoom in"" on something, to zoom back out i have to turn the camera off and back on.   to my knowledge, the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems.  i'm disappointed because i do like the photos that the camera takes when it does function properly. fortunately, i bought it at costco, so it's going back.",0
"like most people i got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image.  i've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment.  sure enough: * the shutter cover has often stuck open or shut. * sometimes it refuses to start at all. * it sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera. * finally, the lcd stopped working altogether.  this is after 8 months.casio has decided i'm not under warranty (no explanation as to why, no phone number to argue with them), and is charging me $97 to repair it.don't be seduced! it's a poor quality product",0
"please be aware of this camera's shock sensitivityi was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the second time. it's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world. the result is it loses it's ability to focus and zoom. it didn't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket, with the lens protruding, thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly.the first time it happened casio repaired it under warranty. the second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that's more than 1/3 the original purchase price. i won't reinvest in a weak product. i'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether",1
"just for the record, my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier casio models. presently in iraq, i do want to have a camera with me, but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service. sad. it looked to be a great camera",0
"i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years.   i love everything canon does.  however i do not understand canon's reasoning behind producing this lens.the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the ""film"" plane.  they cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens.they have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro.as i said, if for $60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on all canon cameras, i'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all.granted, you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon, but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr's, so why bother with this lens?the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me.my $0.0",1
"after reading the many good reviews here, i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera.  i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem.  this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  i could view previously taken pictures (lcd ok) but any new photo i tried to take was black. i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  so, was it the lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day?  i can't say for sure, but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the lcd since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots).",1
"i have had this camera since jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings. don't expect much from it and you will be happy. as an entry level dslr it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. i find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving. cons:in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.battery dies fast. the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in raw mode. i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode(approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. surprisingly when shooting jpegs, i get more shots per charge(over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike. so i always carry a backup film camera (my trusty elan 7).the viewfinder is very dim. when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d's viewfinder. in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus. autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. when shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.the 420ex flash is supposed to ""talk"" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. however, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. after about five months, the shutter button started sticking. i would click it and then it would remain depressed. the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little.another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. and since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. for example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.so would i recommend this camera:if you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos. but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere",0
"hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, i have a problem with my camera and i don't have anyone to help, i've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where i can ask for some help, i don't really understand why is this site so well known on &quot;customer service&quot;, but i just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, i'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the &quot;help area&quot;. i need to repair my lcd monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all",1
the camera worked perfectly for one week and then stopped working permanently. i just sent it off for repairs and have not received a diagnosis as to the root of the problem,1
"i received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. i was shocked, i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this.",1
"when i opened the package, i found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. i thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. when i opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. while it's bad sign, i still thought it's ok as long as i could put them together. well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (i never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). before to ship it back, i did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! i couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from amazon, not from some unknowns of ebay (actually, any ebayer will have to worry about the feedback). i was really shocked that amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!hope this is just a random incident and amazon does have a very easy return practice. otherwise, i would not buy anything from amazon",1
"i picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake.  the class came chipped, scratched and smuged; tiffen filters are of very poor quality.do yourself a favor, like i did, and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe, oh, 10 dollars more.  this tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting",0
do not buy the case canon sells for this camera. it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in,1
"they tell you tha this product holds 6aa batteries, and works with the 20d's battery grip, but when i received the item it is for a completely different product and does not work with the 20d's bg-e2 grip.  it has the product name of cpm-e3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 aaa batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the bg-e2.",1
"as a professional photographer, i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. my equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit!)the cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months",0
"i am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  two have broken.  as other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the ""female"" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black ""spring"" cover over the screws on the shoe.  you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  canon should do this at the factory.i use this cord with a stroboframe ""portrait/landscape"" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.  unfortunately, i do not believe that there are alternative cords. it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords",0
"i have been using this cord for about a year, and i had problems with its durability.  it actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  when mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  i had to buy a replacement part from canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  i flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  i wrote to canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. so far, there is no response.  a few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ettl to ttl mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  i checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ettl mode.  for a piece of equipment from canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. it's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  as there are no other oem manufacturers of this cord, i am forced to get another one and hope for the best.",0
"over 90% of pictures i took by this canon are blurry. no way can you fix it. i really got fed up with it. waist your money. waist your time. more important, waist your precious moments!",1
"i have known canon to be a very high quality company. however, i was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations i had about this camera. a few years ago i bought the fujiffilm 3800. i loved this camera but after a few ski trips i found it rather bulky. i then bought the canon s500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the s400. for most of the pictures i take on a ski trip this camera is fine. however, if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime, this camera is worse than a disposable camera. first, there is no red-eye reduction. it simply does not work when i set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. second, pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. i would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. third, night picture?....forget about it. i tried to get a beatiful picture of the chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. so, i tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and i could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. looks like i'll be back in the market for a fujifilm. after all the reviews i've read, i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (e18, lcd, etc.). not to mention the terrible service that i have been reading about",0
"after just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read ""e18"".  so i was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that canon refuses to admit.  try googling canon s500 e18"", and you'll see what i meant.don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight",0

"i purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last march. i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support. they went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. well i followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. so they said i should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. then i sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. they sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. well i just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. they never fixed the problem. mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. i called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. she said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. well i was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late august a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. she said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. i told i have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before i sent it in the first time. i started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when i got off the phone. the camera is worse than a disposable camera. don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. i recommend olympus. my olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. i am planning on contacting the better business bureau regarding this matter. please don't waste your time on this, like i have to! i hope this helps people make better choices! good luck! i wish someone could have forecasted this for me",1
"don't buy this camera!!!  prone to ""memory error"" & e18 errors after warranty is up.  cost min $150 plus shipping to fix.this camera was great until 23 months went by then i started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors.  i switched memory cards and it happened again.  then the ""memory error"" displayed after a month or so of losing pictures.  now it doesn't work at all.  i called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem.  minimum cost is $150 or i could upgrade to a refurb s500 for $199 w/6 month warranty.  they have to be kidding, $250 get me a new one.  for what appears to be common problem i was expecting more from canon.  guess i won't be buying another canon.google this ""canon ""memory error"" e18"" and see for yourself that canon cameras have problems.",0
the powershot a520 on switch stopped working right after i started using the camera,0
"for average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. i don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. so, i don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. it was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good",1
"i have owned several canon digital cameras and like them very much.  i purchased the a520 as a gift for a family member.  after several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  it would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  the key word being stick or stuck.  i took it to a canon service center and they repaired it under warranty.  after trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  i took it back to the service center and they repaired it again.  while looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  it was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  after emailing canon they said to just email them if i have a problem and they would see what they could do.  very poor.  i like canon digital cameras but wish i had never purchased the a520.  i bought it because of it's low price, which was a big mistake",0
"this is my third digital camera, i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports.after a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it.  i would manually open up the lens cover each time.  then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that.   but now the camera is almost completely dead.  it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  i'm not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this.i will not buy another canon camera.  this camera was made too cheaply.  i wish things were not made to break right away",0
i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital.  the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used.  the delay between pictures is incredibly long.  the lens/shutter doesn't open properly.  (two other family members who own powershot a520's are having the same problems,0
this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it doesn't seem to fit my mark ii body properly.,0
"ok, maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose doesn't smudge the lcd screen as much.  the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera.  both my 30d and rebel xt.  if i am lucky enough it will fall off, get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory",1
"i wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as i can to help keep the shot stable (i shoot birds at 700mm). the first thing my friend and i did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. in other words - completely useless",1
"yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), but there is a major problem with this.  the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses.",0

the frame and the pictures it displays are fine.  sometimes it is a little hard to get it to download photos from my pc.  my major complaint is the power supply.  the original power supply dies after 4 months.  it was repalced under warranty (after some grief with customer service).  the raplacement died some months later after the warranty had expired.  i then had to buy one.  that one died after a few months and the company didn't have the replacement in stock.  after months of waiting from them to stock the item i gave up and after lots of searching on the web i found a supply made by another compay.  i had to change the connector to make it match the connector on the frame.  it's been doing fine since then.  i should note that my daughter has the same frame and has had almost identical problems.  it looks like there are a lot more of these types of frames on the market now.  i would do a lot of shopping before buying this one,0

"it looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. like a brand named leather wallet. but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  there is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). there is no way to clip to the belt. will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. bought another handy synthetic case afterwards",1

i purchased a 510 powershot in summer of 2005. after couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work anymore. i cound't take any picture anymore. i contacted canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix.,0
"i admit that i'm far from an expert on digital cameras. i did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.i purchased a 510 powershot in july of 2005. it wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them. i can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, but once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (i also emailed them the same request). neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon's behalf.that in itself was enough for me and i've been bitter about that ever since. i've also told every person that i've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. i'm pleased to say, i've steered most away from this company.what else can i say about this camera:this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. i've missed out on some good shots due to this.it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa's to even make this camera worth its while.i've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are very white. almost like looking at an infra red photograph.when filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. like i said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?i wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion. think about that. you have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still under warranty. that's disgusting, that's all i have to say.there should be a zero for this, not a 1 star",1
i agree with m. arse with the 2star rating. i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. i'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers. i've read that it has much better shutter speed. recommended??,0
"i have owned this camera for about a year and i have never really enjoyed it.  for a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and i often miss out on a good shot.  it is also not as user friendly as i would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  while i enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  i have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but i rarely get a good picture when i need it.  i never had these problems with my elph s200.  this camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. if given the option i would not buy this camera again",1
i've had the a510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2m camera.after six months the lens and cover have jammed and i noticed that many amazon reviewers have had the same issue. one evening i took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate.i'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers.,1
i paid extra for air next day service.  item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately.  item eventually arrived two weeks later.  i had left for a trip.  item was eventually sent back to merchant.  merchant didn't credit me for item returned.  i had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited.  i won't buy from willoughby's again,1
"i bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. but the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the error 18 (e18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. i searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then i read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many canon cameras have the same defect... i am really mad and dissapointed on canon, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and i wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or less and then throw your money to the trash",0
"when i received the camera i thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture. after 6 months use, i wish i could give it a 0 star. it's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. it droped twice when i took pictures. also the lens is too small. the dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever. the battery is very small too. after 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures!they have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. it's not a user friendly camera.",1
"sd110 not a good digital camera. better yet find something else. i've had this camera almost a year but i just seldom use it because the result of the pictures are very disappointing. it is just fine downloading them on the internet but when you have it printed on the paper, the pictures get blurred. now,im looking for another digicam that won't disappoint me",0
"it's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs -- this hood.  how can you pay $75 for a great prime lens, and $25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it",1
"boy, this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens.  it's a great a lens, but this is hardly worth the price",1
"the camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. the case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (i've heard the case will darken your camera, but i didn't end up using the case). the neck strap is not useful, it's too long. at '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (the canon camera rocks, however.",0
"a close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera.  honestly olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400.  i've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10.  if you're going to spend that much on a camera, get the d70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with.  the pictures are better and it offers more mp",1
"this camera will probably go down in nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january 2003. from the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  i also bought the sb800s (3 of them), thinking the cls would be a great addition. but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.the camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. but the results are disappointing. the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (canon) offers. nikon finally realized this and on dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. it just so happened mine was in melville, n.y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. these include bad af performance since upgrading to v2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value.i would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers. indeed, forget nikon and go to canon",0
"good: motor drive speed.  grip feel. takes nikon lenses.  reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.bad: skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  white balance doesn't balance well. noise at anything above iso 200, looks like 3200. cf card door tough to open. screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. battery cover is not part of the battery.  button placement not as intuitive as on the d100.  4.1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.  dumped mine a month after i got it",0
"while this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. horribly slow autofocus. i am already saving to buy and l-series or the is usm version",0
i found the product to be made very poorly....all it too is one drop on the floor and the camera battery door cracked and that was is for the camera too....not a kid friendly camera at all,1
"i bought this for my 8 year old daughter to begin learning about digital photography. it has been nothing but a headache from day one. we have yet to be able to download any pictures. all of the endless number of pictures she has taken have been erased before we can download them. the one button mode is very confusing and the directions although written in english seem to be in a foreign language.  the directions say do not return to the store if you are having difficulties. you are suppose to call the phone #, but good luck getting through. i've tried for 2 days straight. they apparently are experiencing high call volume from all the other unhappy customers who were fooled into buying this ""educational camera"".  as i am shopping for another camera, i will not buy anything from the company who manufactured this camera-  sakar",0
"this camera is garbage. it was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money. it was hard to figure out, it took lousy pictures, it burned through batteries. avoid this camera. i just wish i could give it zero stars",0
"got this from toys-r-us for 35 dollars, it stopped working within a week,if there was a rating less than one star i'd give it that, they should call it dummy - buyer - you've - been - conned camera ki",0
"i purchased this for my 4 year old son because he loves to take pictures.  i didn't want to spend a lot of money, however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use.  not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working.  however, when it did work every single picture was blurry.  there is only one button for every option and it is very confusing.  i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  it is being returned",0
this camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work.  it's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures.  when you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible.  we trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing,0
"i had just recently bought this camera, and it was ok. the quaility of the pictures was pretty ok. i couldnt really understand it, and what really stinks is that i lost the stupid cd that comes with it and now i cant install it. overall i would say that the camera is a stinky peice of junk. now im begging my parent to buy me a reall digital camera!!not a peice of crap.",0
was dropped onece and it broke. computer doen't recongise software with windows xp. kids were disappointed they couldn't see there pictures. called the company and they were no help,0
"we bought three of these for christmas presents and two of them stopped working already.  they won't turn on at all.  one of them broke almost immediately, and philips sent a refurbished unit to replace it.  that one is now broken, too.  the units have not been dropped or mistreated in any way.",0
"up to you, but i would buy a generic branded battery of the same type (lithium bp522).  i bought a generic battery and it works just as well -- saved me $50",1
"this one is a product of bad quality, the cap of the batteries to a few days i damage enough of light is needed in order that the sign meets slightly clear, product of bad quality i do not recommend it to him(you,them) and for quality the price must be low",0
"well at least, some stuff is cool, free cam bag, the pics come out excellent. the video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard. also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam. the adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining. the sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to ""freeze up"".bottom line...i recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams...but this one...isnt worth 159 or whatever. its trash. go for something else",1
not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on. i would turn it off and on and nothing would help. finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in. this seemed to fix the problem a few times. after that i thought it was just operator error. but it wasn't. the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile. an event came up about a month later. i got my camera and tried to turn it on. nothing happened. so i changed the batteries. still nothing happened. i'm not sure what happened. i do believe i purchased a lemon camera. i'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung. it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. so i guess you get what you pay for!,0
"i guess i really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of crap",1
"i purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. i would not recommend this camera.",0
"i thought i was ordering the right size batteries, but i found out too late this was not the case. now i am unable to get full credit for them when i return them",1
"i only wish i had read the previous review before i bought this item.  i too was trying to convert my hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass-through on my sony minidv handycam.  i bought this way-too-expensive cable, mostly because it was the only option available.  it seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low-end disk drive or graphics card, considering the technology involved in those devices.but my real problem is with the failure of sony to reveal that the s-video connection is useless for input.  this information is nowhere on the package, nor is it on their website.  there is a notice saying ""please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase"".  you can't read that warning when buying online, and if buying at a store, there's no way to know what's compatible because they don't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package. i guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website, then come back to the store and buy it, instead of just buying it and seeing if it works.there is a section of the handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one, however they fail to mention that the sony cable won't work, despite the premium price they charge.  if the problem is that they couldn't make it work with both a composite and s-video cable, then they should have just made it work for s-video, since a composite cable comes with the camera.shame on you, sony, for adding a little aggravation to my day, and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard.  it's enough to make me want to buy a canon camcorder (i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i don't want to submit to proprietary sony standards like memorystick).rant over.",0
"conclusions:to start from the end i got the xacti ca6, tested it and returned it. here are the pros and cons.pros - 1. very small, just put in your pocket and go2. easy and simple controls3. super fast start up from sleep mode4. good video quality when lighting conditions are good5. the ability to take stills while in video mode (i had no issue with the video pausing, no way around that)6. you get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price7. sd card that records for a long time8. easy transfer to computer for editing cons - 1. indoor video unacceptable, although the video is brighter the ones my sony digicam takes, it is extremely grainy (more so than my sony digicam videos!!)2. super slow zoom when in video mode3. in good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry (especially when trying to capture a kid on the move, for scenery it might be ok)4. in low lighting stills are unusable (even at short distance) due to a very, very weak flash.5. red eye almost every time the flash works6. strap is a joke7. no lens coverso in short, on paper this camera is great, i love having the sd format rather than tape or dvd, the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless. but....the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting (see above) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions (for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical).this camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand (for taking stills). for almost everyone else it is not adequate, i will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a minidv camcorder  (going for the elura 100).....ya, i know people told me that this was the best option beforehand, i was hoping to prove them wrong....; - (",1
"in an email, adorama specified that the filter diameter was, ""28mm."" on the amazon.com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting! either they don't know their products or they don't care about the customers. now i have to return it because of faulty information they supplied. please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25% of the purchase price - an amount i feel is beyond absurd. i can buy this locally for a lot less (even though i would have to pay sales tax). buyer beware",0
"my cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so i ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one.  although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 cannon took much clearer pictures.  i have had this camera for 9 months and i am sending it in for the second time for repair.  first the power button stopped working, and then on easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched.  when i pushed delete, the menu came up.  even the mode selector wasn't working.  it was reviewing the pictures in all three modes.  i will say that sony support online is very helpful, but i need something more reliable.  i am done with this camera",1
"it worked fine the first week. then the focus stopped working. i sent it to repair. it worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working. i sent it for repair for the second time. it worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working. also, it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at sony!!! they make you wait over an hour!!!si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for!!!sony repair reference number: e3317596",1
"after a few months use the camera got persnickety, often demanding upon startup that i restart it. now that the camera has completely broken down, with the lens fully extended and stuck in place, i think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate. another durability issue concerns the finish: the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review, flash, etc., quickly wore off, and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera. not a big deal in itself, but annoying given the other problem.the lens is prone to strange flaring, especially indoors, where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame. several photos were ruined, or have required tedious photoshopping. otherwise, the lens is fine and reasonably sharp, although nothing to write home about.the camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models, e.g., canon a610. many frames are motion-blurred, as well. there are ways to avoid this, but i didn't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure, thank you.there are a few things to recommend it: not only is it relatively inexpensive, it has a lens significantly wider than the competition--31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm. those few mm's make a big difference when you can't move back far enough to get everything in the frame. it is also quick in its operations (except when hunting for focus, see above.) the jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful--bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost--but generally everything looks good. skintones are good.still, with the durability issue, this one's not worth it. lucky for me, unlike the other user who seemingly experienced the same type of breakdown, i did keep the receipt. anyone wanna buy a memory stick pro duo",0
half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless.  should have sent it back,0
"i made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. the color and noise was terrible. if you want a great point and shoot camera get the canon powershot s50 while they are still available. the camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. if you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery cathreen styles. all most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. i am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. by the way, i did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. i got the canon 30d and love it",1
"i purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model fujifilm camera, reviews here, price and functions. at the same time, i also purchased the larger xd card. almost out of the box, this camera has given me nothing but grief. what others had said about the blurry photos i can certainly echo. a month or so after purchase, the lens would not open, or it would not open totally. i first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries, the problems still existed - some of the time. not always - just sporadically. just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities. in addition to that, now that i'm looking at other brands of cameras i find the xd card i purchased is not transferable so i'm out the cost of that as well. another malfunction of this camera is after ""erasing"" all photos on the xd card, taking more photos and uploading the new photos, i found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones? i don't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera. i would not recommend this camera to anyone....it's a total dud. i'm very disappointed with fujifilm and am now looking at nikon and cannons. good luck fujifulm...you need it",1
"i was super-excited to get this camera, and very disappointed with it once i did.  the pictures are blurry far more often than not, even when resting the camera on a table or solid object.  additionally, it's so slow at taking them that any movement (eyes blinking, etc) likes like a massive blur.  and the video skips all the time.  it just misses entire parts.  i would highly recommend not getting this camera.",1

"i purchased this item two weeks ago.  my thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced, perfect addition to the ""tools"" necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby (its advertised contents, construction, and ""glow-in-the-dark"" planisphere).  after closely examining the item for the past ten days, i'm forced to conclude that i was in error, and that you really do get what you pay for.  as celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy, i must confess that i assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name.  i have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps.  the major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings, letter transpositions, apparent omitted words, and just plain (what we used to call in the old days) ""typographical errors.""  additionally, when i compare some of the technical information on the maps (i.e., star magnitudes, astronomical distances, etc.)and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources i have in my possession, i also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances.  when using a product like this, it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains.  since i'm not able to do this, i must rate this item with one star.  when i purchased the item, it was marked down by twenty percent.  i note that in less that two weeks since my purchase, the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent.  in this case, don't be fooled (as i was) by an attractive price.  avoid this product.

"great features, right?i just returned it after very disappointing results.here are just a few issues:1. if you use a tripod (and you will need to), you can't plug in the ac adapter to save on the short battery life, because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the ac connection.2. battery life is very short.3. if you want to protect the lens, you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens.4. you can't take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter because the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures.5. the automatic settings are horrible. the auto focus, auto white balance, auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors.6. you cannot adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording.7. quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light.save your money. buy a camera with better features. i am waiting for the panasonic hdc-sd1 due in march",0

"i have been working with this camera for about a year now, for product shots online, and while sometimes it takes great pics, many times the flash pops and whites out, or it goes off and you get a black picture. i take pictures of jewelry, and if i try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration, the color is not accurate. purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up. while you can fiddle with 4 different picture taking settings, in all different modes, you'll never get the same picture twice, even saving the setting. the light has to be just so, to get a good shot. when it shoots clearly, it can take fabulous pictures, but often, pics are blurred as many others have said, when they actually come out. my old camera, the dsc p71 3.2 megapixel is much better, colors are accurate always, shooting is flawless and foolproof every time, and the greatest feature is re-sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading. this feature is completely missing from the dsc p200, which was the biggest disappointment, as i figured it would be a given i didn't have to ask about when purchasing. why would sony eliminate this great function? had i know that when the salesman at the large new york city photo store told me this was the camera i dreamed of, i would not have bought it. i prefer also to use the rechargable aa batteries instead of the lithium battery, which is super hard to load, and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with. it is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle. every time it takes me several minutes, and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem. i recently took this camera on vacation to take pics and get footage for burning to dvd. sound quality is good, but video quality can be choppy, and the monitor did not let me even see that my setting was overexposed, so all my footage is somewhat overexposed for the entire trips shootings i made. the monitor, while big, does not show you always what you are shooting, whether a still, or movie picture. overall, i would not recommend this camera and i actually bought a used second of my old camera, and got my original repaired, because this one doesn't compare. this camera is a bit too complicated and not very user friendly. even after using all this time, i still am not sure what i am going to get when i use this camera. i'd say the worst features to be aware of are for someone who needs accurate color, this camera clearly has trouble showing blue/green shades, and purples accurately, you can never show these colors are they are in life with this camera, and the lack of the ""trimming"" resizing feature, what was sony thinking? next time, i am trying something other than sony cybershot unless i hear they have gone back to making a great straightforward, uncomplicated easy to point and shoot camera. this one is definitely not",1

"hp is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when i found it here for $10 less i couldn't let this ""deal"" pass me by... however when i received the bag, i wished i had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus hp isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!",1
"i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon.  it was, in my opinion, not worth the price i paid!  the picture looked much larger that it actually was.  i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied.  in this case i did not have time to find another camera case. thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion.linda sutto",1
"so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like ""um... is that it???"" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards... also, there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it, also, the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all... other than that, it's cute, but not the best out there.",0
probably would buy other camera if i could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash. it is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures. you have to learn how to be very steady with it,1
"i owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me, and i said ""thank you!"" because i hated the thing.  i used to have a 4mp samsung and it was better than this one.  the worst problem: slow.  slow slow slow.  if you use the flash, be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture.  it's worse at low battery strength, but even with fresh batteries it was tedious.the other thing that disappointed me was the color.  the light from the flash is glaring and unnatural, and without the flash everything is reddish, grainy, and blurry.  i never found a decent middle ground.  i take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light, and my samsung wasn't great but it was better than this one.  when i look at the pictures i've uploaded on my computer, i can see the difference when my old camera died and i got the nikon.the worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else's camera and wishing i owned that one.do some research before you make a mistake like i did. i've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera",0
"i purchased this camera right before we had our first child. needless to say, i would have rather donated the money to charity! the flash recovery time is ridiculously slow, but that i can live with. the 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry, i can not. now i have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on. needless to say i think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera",0
"last year, i purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my nikon 2100. i am extremely upset over this purchase i have made, since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures. the nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside.  the indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint, and does not focus well. however, the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp. i tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures. the outdoor video works well on this camera too. i am giving this low one-star rating, since many events tend to be held indoors. this was definitely my final nikon purchase ever",1
"i bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable.  the problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds. during this time the camera's view finder goes black and you cannot use it.  because the camera is so slow, we have missed many important pictures of our children; consequently, we found that for any important family events, this is not the camera we use.  i own nikon 35mm slr cameras and i am shocked that nikon would sell this unusable product.  if it is your life your recording, i recommend that you buy a different camera",1
"unless you take picture outside, no matter what you do, the picture comes out blurry.flash doesn't help at all- it takes more than 5 seconds for it to take a picture, and you still get a blurry picture with horrible quality indoors. my sister had a camera from olympus, with 5 megapixel and 3x zoom too, but i found it so much easier to take a picture(and a better one too) with that one. unless you want to buy your 5th grader his/her toy camera, you shouldn't consider nikon 5600.",1
"i bought this camera a year ago, the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light, but for using indoor (with flash) is very, very bad. when you use flash the photo are not good, but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice, if you can bought another camera.",0
"i made sure i did my research and read all the reviews on various cameras before deciding to go with this one.i was highly disappointed when i got my camera home and put in the batteries, turned it on and immediately  the lens got stuck in the ""out"" position with an error reading that said:  lens error, restart camera.  i tried to restart it a zillion times, only for it to say the same thing.  i went on line and found that this is a problem with some canon cameras and now, instead of being excited about having this particular camera, i am completely disappointed.  i'm glad others have had such good luck with their cameras.  please research the error because, in some cases, it didn't happen until a year later",0
"i bought htis from amazon, and have troubles in playing back the video clips. almost evrytime, after a while, i do see ""system error"" on the screen, and then the firmware is hung. after a power-cycle, the last recorded clip is gone! some issues with the basics...so i called sanyo service, they said this is happening because i'm using a 4gb plain sd card. acc to the support guy, max of 2gb of plain sd is supported , for more gb, a sdhc card is needed. i could not find this info on the manual or spec...so i'm not sure how true is this. if anyone of you know about this , please let me know.video is okay for my need...still is too bad. firmware is just about average..not too great. there is much scope of improvement to be more user friendly and more informative with lesser use of buttons.battery did not perform as promised in the spec. also, there are way too many components in the box for such a specialized product. i would expect those many in a robotics kit.",1
"i have to say i am very disappointed with this camera.  i had really high hopes for this one.  i waited for the hd2 to come out and when i saw a lot of positive reviews i bought one, i should have waited.  for sanyo to call this an hd camera doesn't make sense.  the picture has more grain and noise then my old high 8 camera.  outdoors in bright light the camera is ok. low-light is horrible pros:- nice form factor, love the look and feel and it's so tiny it fits in your pocket.  very portable and something you can take anywhere. - secure digital cards are great, can transfer and edit on the computer quickly- still pictures are pretty good.  although still digital cameras are better.- hdmi output can plug directly into your hdtv (although if you are used to watching things in hd you will be disappointed)cons:- indoor and low light situations very grainy, even with the high sensitivity button.- don't attempt to take still shots while you are filming, it works but when you watch the film you hear loud noises and the shot pauses for 2 or 3 seconds and then continues.  very cheesy.- you can hear the data being written to the secured digital card on the video which is annoying.  i thought sd was supposed to minimize noise.  - watching the playback of movement with this makes me dizzy, not even fast movement either.- image stabilization is not that great either compared to other cameras i have used.- audio sounds a bit tinny in my opinion this camera is geared for portability and being able to capture moments quickly as this is something you can always carry with you.  if you aren't too concerned with quality picture it's probably fine. i really think sanyo has a great concept and one day this could be the end all be all device.  for now it should come with a warning of it's limitations.  i am not saying it's total garbage, but if you have high hopes like i did, you will be disappointed.",1
"as i watch the videos of my kids on my 50"" plasma, 32"" lcd and mac, trying to convince myself that i like the quality, my wife walks by and says, ""fuzzy."" i know most guys out there will know what i'm talking about - she just killed the deal. regardless of the specs, the wives don't lie - the picture quality just doesn't cut it. it's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old sony dvr. the product design is cool, the price is good, the sd card recording idea is perfect, but the hd promise doesn't come close to paying off.if you're looking for sharp, crystal clear images - you're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle.",1
"i got mine today, and it is being returned today.  i had high hopes, given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity.  i was hoping for an all-in-one device for stills and video.  here's my results:1) stills.  pictures are not too bad, but do not compare with a similar 7mp canon sd500 which i own.  the zoom works well, focusing is ok, but slow.  the pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them, flash or not, like they are all taken at a high iso setting on a regular digital cam.  so slight disappointment here.2) video.  if this is improved low light sensitivity, i would not have liked to see the results on the hd1!  video does not even come close to comparing to my regular sony dv camera.  focusing is hit or miss, and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my sony.i really was hoping for the be all end all combo device, but the hd2 does neither very well.  ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well.  the finish is great and the buttons are well placed.  but it doesn't justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves",1
"if you got here looking for a bag for an xacti camera, keep looking. this bag is too small. it can be used for holding memoery cards and batteries, but not much more.",1
"ok, i was hasty in this purchase.  at first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14, shipping included.  then i got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera i ordered.  you see, the dimensions listed under ""more details"" are for the outside of the case, not the inside (but it doesn't say interior nor exterior, just gives dimensions).  turns out, not only do you have to click ""more details,"" (fine print) you also have to click ""more technical details."" (finer print)  wish i had now.  just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case.  electrogalaxy will not refund shipping charges, and they charge a %20 restocking fee.  so, at most, after i pay return shipping, (the case is only $4) i might get back $2.  so, yeah i was hasty, but i was also robbed",1
"i purchased this along with a sony dcrhc21.  this carry case was listed as an accesory so i expected it to be appropriately sized (as other sony cases i've purchased fit like a glove).  this  case is entirely too large to hold a minidv camcorder.  the camcorder rattles around inside it.  if you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one.  otherwise i suggest you look at the product specifications, note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder's size.",1
"the look and feel of this camcorder is very good. unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities. for example, evening party, indoor school activities, kid drama and orchestra. this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities. earlier i had a sony dcr trv140, which was way better than this camcorder.this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price. one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom. most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors. these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light.if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light, i do not recommend it.",0
"after a week of using this i find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing.  mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect, so maybe the motor was already fixed :-)  my mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender.  the zr 500 is ok in low light, but you can adjust the exposure manually to correct if it isn't to your liking. you can also adjust the focus too!my friend who is a mini dv guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par.  i've made two practice dvd's (with firewire, no problem at all) with this camera and like what i see.  for those of you that have bad motornoise: try your video software to edit the noise out.  power director has that feature.i am happy with this product, but i would rather have a higher end model now that i have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder.a great camcorder for beginners!",1
why do you need a water house for a camera that is 10m water proof,1
"i have owned the s410 camera for almost two years, when on new years eve i pulled out my handy camera, from the padded case it's always in, and to my horror, the e18 error message appeared! it hasn't worked since. i paid $400 for this camera and canon would like $110 (plus taxes) to fix the problem - ridiculous. especially since this seems to be a very common problem with their cameras. i've enjoyed the camera's picture quality and ease of use, but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years! beware of this flaw that canon doesn't seem to acknowledge",0
"beware of this camera! the camera overall works great. we have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use.  very nice compact size.  however, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again.  there is no battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced.  we were warned about this so i thought, no problem, i'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed.  but what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. i had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon.",0
"when i got this camera for my birthday april 2005 i thought that it was a dream come true. the picture quality was brilliant, it was easy to use. the device was ment to be envied. it took marvelous pictures until within 3 months, july 2005- the lcd screen cracked. the camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage. i was never suspiscious of it until i took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems. something bad will happen to this camera. either the sceen will break or the memory card thing. a friend of mine also owned the s410, and her screen broke before mine did. the camera still takes photos, but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options. it is not worth the price of repair. tomorrow i am going to buy a new camera.",0
"this was the first digital camera i purchased. i am an adventurous person and  wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle. this camera wasn't it. the good*it is compact, which is pretty convenient*it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy. the bad*after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes, the camera leaked and broke. olympus replaced it, but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over. *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use. rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want. the pictures always need touched up afterwards, sometimes seriously.*the zoom sucks. don't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience.*the image stabilization is a joke. you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren't blurry. *the user manual left me with a lot of questions",1

not impressed at all with this product.  you are better off just to plug in your camera in the usb port and let windows process it.  at least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved.  i suggest you don't use easyshare software.  windows pic and fax viewer is far superior to this software.  if you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use easyshare.  the solution to this is to uninstall easyshare and all pics with revert to windows,1
"i purchased this wide angle lens for my digital camera.  when i was experimenting with it taking photos inside my house, there was a dark shadow in the lower right hand portion of the photo.  when i took a photo outside, there was no shadow.  i went to my local camera shop to ask for help in this matter and he said i would need to adjust the white balance according to the light in the room, but he said, in reality, 'these digital cameras are really not meant for attachments'.  i did experiment with the light balance, but still had no luck in getting that dark area to disappear.the flash on the camera is not strong enough to compensate for the area the lens blocks.  i returned the product.",0

"bought this as an xmas present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel. i'm now on the 2nd unit (exchanged directly w/phillips), and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external (in my case, sony memory sticks).the internal memory is pitiful, and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it, you are not going to be able to hold very many internally.i've yet to get the auto on/off feature to work, and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device, it's certainly not always mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with, and the directions meager.i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag, the fact that the support stand can't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course, no mention of this in the product description.also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - no support for the new, ms produo sticks (and no mention of that in the product descriptions either)i thought i would get a quality product from phillips, and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately, it's turned out to be a piece of junk, one i've been screwing around with for so long that it's probably not returnable.don't waste your time and dollars.......................",1
"but the stitching was irregular on the front. i thought the company produced good products, but i was mistaken when i bought this item. next time i'll just go to bestbuy for a camera case",1
"probably a very good case, but not a very operatable one in the field - you have to undo two closures to open the camera compartment, a strap and a velcro.  the shoulder strap is not detachable - looks kind of silly when you are trying to use the belt strap.  for the olympus stylus digital cameras, look to the lowepro case - better case and value",1
"the product advertisement is misleading or incomplete (no picture of the actual contents).  the following quote is from fuji mall:""ac adapter: charge your batteries at home or around the world with the travel adapters.""what it fails to mention is that the charger is an external charger only, and you cannot power the camera or charge batteries while in the camera. i was looking for an ac adapter that i can power the camera (and charge it's batteries inside the camera).the nimh cells are not the 2500 ma/hr rating that comes with the e900 camera (they are 2000 ma/hr, but this was noted in the product specifications).i teach a photography class and needed an ac adapter to power each camera used during the class while demonstrating.  this product does not meet this criteria.  it can however charge up to 4-aa batteries at a time, and includes an auto adapter which is handy.case is bulky, not small enough to tote an e900 conveniently when not bringing the charger equipment",0
i will keep this review simple.for the price this is an ok deal.however:the bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop.the battery charger is finicky and has below average build qualitybatteries are generic rechargeables.you are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger/batteries. it will wind up costing you less in the long run,1
"if you can actually get the picture to turn out right, it does take pretty decent pictures.  most of the time the photo is either over-exposed or too dark and grainy.  it also only holds about 5 pictures, so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot.  i was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars, and it doesn't really seem worth it",1

"i purchased this camera after reading reviews and tech specs about the camera. it's either not enough, or it's too much ... i'm not sure which. i returned it and purchased a 10 megapixel powershot a640 which has a swiveling view finder (which is great!) and will suit my needs just fine for about $200 less.",0
"i bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the smartmedia (which only lasts for about a month). i would have to say that i am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the powershot sd1000, my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos.it's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. so blurry that i had to use photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. the right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable.maybe i simply got one with a bad lens. in any case, no thanks, i'll stick with my trusty old camera. i would rather pay for a new smartmedia card each month.",0
"the panasonic is very compact, very stylish sexy as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa.the colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. if one investigates such things, will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as sony's, canon improves this to 180, and nikon is at 300 dpi. it is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format, take the photos, pop the sd card  into the computer, compare the images in photoshop. enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. that is what i did, since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too",0

when i was buying my husbands olympus camera this rechargeable battery popped up as a suggested purchase to go with camera so i ordered it.  not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it i assumed it was compatable with the camera i was purchasing at that time.  no it was not!!!  so i paid for and wraped (christmas present) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable.  now i have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again...not to mention the frustration of a return!!!!not a happy amazon shopper!,0

"my title says it all - i was really disappointed with this camera, but before i get into the specifics as to why, i must mention a few things first.  this was my third camera in the exilim line - prior to purchasing z850 i have owned z60, as well as z600.  both were great cameras.  i mean, what's not to like?  clean, sexy look; easy to use; great picture quality.  but having to work for kodak in the past, i decided that i want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing, and in order to do that i needed something with a little more manual control, so i sold my z600, and got a z850 instead.  big mistake!  i ordered it directly from amazon, and it was a brand new camera.  right of the bat i got a defective unit!  the problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures, especially close-ups.  the shots were blurry for the most part, and the colors were a bit off as well.  how is that for quality and reliability?!  but i thought to myself, ""it's okay, it happens"", so i returned it back to amazon (thanks to their great return policy), and got myself another one, this time from techtoysforless (it was a lot cheaper comparing to amazon).  one thing to be aware of - techtoysforless sells what it's called ""grey market"" cameras.  i knew about it ahead of time, but someone might not, and then be unpleasantly surprised.  for those who don't know what it is - the ""grey market"" refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer.  only new products fall under the legal, accepted definition of grey market.  grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods.  frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. this situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment, such as cameras.   entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there.  so, the product is legal, it's new, and it's cheap.  but... in some instances, there could be minor differences between the ""authorized"" product, and the ""grey market"" one.  for example, a ""grey"" z850 doesn't have an ebay mode, but offers an ""auction"" mode instead.  it's a bit different with respect to settings.  also, there is no full blown manual in the box, but rather a short ""how to"" instruction in various languages.  however, the full manual can be found on a cd-rom.  another difference, and that's actually a plus i think, is that it comes with a european power adapter, whereas american sold models don't have that.  the biggest concern with ""grey market"" products, however, is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty, so you have to be aware of that, and check before buying.  i knew all of the above, but still took a chance, mainly because the price difference was significant, but also because techtoysforless had a 10-day return policy, and i thought that it would be enough time for me to ""explore"" the camera and find out whether it's defective or not.  in any case, i placed an order, and three days later held a new z850 in my hands.  i didn't waste any time, and when the battery was fully charged, i started taking shots left and right.  all of them were crisp, clear, and sharp, so i knew the unit was good, and the lens wasn't defective as it was with the previous one i had.  however, and i noticed it right away because i tend to take mostly pictures of people, the colors were a bit ""warm"".  what i mean is there was a slight cast of ""pink"" present in all pictures.  you wouldn't notice it in pictures of architecture, food, or nature, but people's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural, and it was very obvious.  neither z60, nor z600 had that problem.  i still kept the camera though because i could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing.  what finally made me gave it up (i sold it on ebay), was the casio's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a ""broken"" movie mode.  the original firmware, version 1.0, that the camera came with had a problem with ""stair stepping"" - the movies were ""jerky"", and ""noisy"".  after numerous complaints by the customers, casio released two new firmware versions, 1.1, and 1.1b that supposedly ""fixed"" the movie issue.  but what they in fact did was just ""cripple"" it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1b, and the picture quality actually got worse!  version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything, but rather ""improved"" already decent picture quality, and added support for high capacity memory cards.  also, i've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning, there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality.  i didn't want to wait to find out, so i got rid off it.i didn't do my usual pros and cons type of review in this case, and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera, but it actually does have a few good things.  for one, in addition to its big, super-bright display, it has a viewfinder!  a big plus in my opinion, especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine.  also, on top of its numerous preprogrammed  best shots, it has some manual controls, giving you even more flexibility.  it's a nice little camera.  unfortunately, it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability.  i wish i could say that i enjoyed using it, but it was more of a hassle than fun.however, i still stand behind casio products.  after i sold z850, i got myself a p700 model, which has been discontinued for some time now, and is virtually impossible to find anywhere.  it's a semi-pro model, and offers even more manual controls than z750/z850 models.  excellent camera!  a true performer!  built like a tank, has a sharp canon lens, and made in japan for a change! (all other exilim models are made in china, which could be the reason for poor quality)  i've used p700 for a couple of months, and... sold it :-)  yep... call me crazy, call me whatever you want - i just decided that i want even more manual control and flexibility, so i got myself panasonic dmc-lx2.  one word - wow!  what a camera!  optical image stabilization, wide angle leica lens, raw format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera.  i've had it only for 2 days now, but i'm already in love with it.  don't forget to check my review of it, which is coming shortly.  i didn't completely abandon casio's though - my present to my wife for valentine's day this year - casio ex-s770 in red color.  i'm definitely going to get my hands on it also, so come back for another review soon.  once again, i hope i've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions.  good luck",1
"this item does not charge your camera.  it does provide power to your camera while plugged in, but it does not recharge your camera's battery",1
pictures do not come out very good. poor quality! i would not recommend it,0
"i can't speak to how well the product performs because mine was doa.  customer service was unable to do anything over the phone.  since it was purchased as a gift and i had time before christmas, i opted for a different brand.  doesn't inspire confidence in their quality control when a unit fails to start up fresh out of the box",0
"i was very excited to see this frame, and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek. i was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality - it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago. the resolution was similar to my first palm pilot (iiix), just enlarged.i sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces. i believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better",1
"they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill. the batteries charged lasted atleast five hours, so no complaints there, but the charger would keep coming out from the wall. it only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it wouldn't stay all the way in, i tried several outlets, finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all",0
"i bought this recharger kit specifically for a sandisk m230 mp3 player.  when i first received the kit, i charged all of the batteries.  upon first use i only got 7min. out of each battery, when i got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  i learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's ""memory effect"" or ""voltage depression,"" my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.  if you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much ""juice"" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit",0
"poor quality unit.  worked sometimes, sometimes not.  gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out",0
"i wish that i could review how well this charger works, but unfortunately i can't.  the reason is because it was dead on arrival.  i essentially bought a $20.00 (with eek technology's outrageous shipping) brick.  it never worked, ever, and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit!  at least i have the 4 batteries it came with, so it isn't a total loss.  don't make the same mistake.  steer clear of this piece of junk",0
this is a 1.2 volt battery charger.  useless for anything that requires aaa 1.5 volt batteries,0
"my primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. the camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). the camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. i believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.i used to have a cannon powershot sd450 that was awesome, but it was stolen and so i needed a replacement. i had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900. i am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose, this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. instead, i just got a fuji finepix f30, which is supposed to be better without the flash. we'll see",1
"""lens error, restart camera"" message appears today (mar 26) after buying production on amazon on feb 20, 07. when i searched google for this error message saw thousands of canon users having similar error / e18 error with older and newer version of the canon. i have tried panasonic and sonys before and never had an issue. i dread that canon customer service is going to waste my hours in getting a replacement and ultimately may end up charging me over a 100 for repairs like they have done to other users(after reading user feedback on web)",0
"i have been searching reviews of the nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and i am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem, and many have taken it up with nikon only to be told 'sorry'.in a nutshell, i am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new slr models.  i purchased the nikon coolpix s7c for my wife, and it is by far the worst one i have owned for many reasons, but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is horrible pictures. the 'electronic vr' is simply digital image sharpening, the iso adjustments in low light are terrible, and what i simply cannot believe is how terrible the autofocus is.  couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily, and you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures",0
"the wifi is a great idea!  the idea on paper sounds amazing, but the way you had to do it was horrible.  it gave you no control over what pictures or anything.  plus it was slow.the picture quality was horrilbe!!!  m y two megapixel cell phone takes better pictures than this camera.  they look amazing on the lcd screen, but once you get them on the computer, they are fuzzy, grainy, etc.i would not recomend this camera to anybody.  yes, it has some nice features, but the pictures are anything but acceptable",1
"the camera feels slick.  the software that comes with it gets a 4 star for efficiency, though the intuitiveness is not its strength.  while the large lcd display is terrific (the main reason i got it), it is worthless in a high glare situation.  you can't see what you are shooting.  it's worthless!  and since nikon did not give you a viewing lense for such situations, there are times whey you have no idea what you are shooting.while the viewing wheel, to rapidly cycle through the shots you've taken, is quite handy, the rest of the navigation is less than intuitive, and often takes so long to figure out that you give up.  pictures are generally good, though the conditions have to be perfect, or you get grain or blur.there is one lovely feature, but it is only useful on a tri-pod.  it is a function which allows you to take a flash photo and have the aperture remain open for a little while after to fill in the background.  it creates flash shots without the black void background typical of such pix.  i use that feature a lot, but its worthless without ""legs"" for the camera.i bought this on a whim, counting on the nikon reputation.  had i known, i would have stuck with the canon",1
i lost the weights the second day of use. bottom line the motion of the water as you swim unscrews the weights from the camera body. save your money on this one.,1
"i really don't know how to write a ""helpful"" review for this camera, i'm not a photographer; all i can say is that i was not satisfied with my purchase, so...***if you're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get (like i was a few months ago), save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras.***here are my complaints:flash is too strong (blinding, in fact). please do not take this complaint lightly, the flash is brighter than you think (it actually hurts, i'm talking physical pain here). i actually fear it might have some long term effects, this alone is a deal-breaker for me! it's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at nikon.sure, you can turn the flash off. but that only brings me to my other major complaint! the lighting must be almost perfect if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash.the lens do not respond well to artificial lighting, at all, pictures either come out all grainy (if it's slightly dark) or with huge white patches all over if there's a lot of light in the background.even when the lighting is almost perfect, you lose a lot of quality (even when using the highest settings, 6mp).the scene modes didn't help much, i tried everything, all the different modes offer so little difference, very gimicky in my opinion.even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash, there's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear, why? i have no clue what so ever. i might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a slightly different pose (but still stable), and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear!must admit though, the swivel design is very practical and makes things so much easier. the video mode is great as well.if you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash, then i must admit, the pictures do come out nicely. (most of the time",1
"i'm a diehard nikon fan.  my first nikon was a gift from my father when i was 13.  since then, photography has been a serious hobby, having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college.  having said that, and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera, i absolutely agree with them.  someone responded by saying those reviewers haven't read the manual.  baloney.  i bought the coolpix l1 to replace a 4 year old coolpix 850.  the l1's camera's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors, especially with the macro settings.  i've been patient and have given it three months.  i am fed up.  this camera is going back to amazon in the morning",1
"very slow storage even with a fast card....small but too thick for comfortable handling. i ended up selling it on ebay and buying a canon sd600 which is a great camera, thin enough to fit in your shirt pocket, fast storage of images and the battery lasts a very long time. i've charged it once and have taken many many holiday pictures. don't buy the nikon without first checking out the canon sd600.",1
"i agree with the people complaining about the poor cs policy at jvc. they let me down as well, when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built. i am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid jvc in the future. i just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit. this will come back and bite them in the behind",1
"this camera was great at first and very easy to use, however, the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well.  when we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture, so we put it in our cedar chest (we keep our house very dry and don't live in a humid area - nebraska).  this worked for a few months, but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless.  i wish it was different, but bottom line, this is a disposable video camera - a nice one, but still disposable",1
"i agree with the many other users who have experienced the ""condensation, operation paused"" defect on their jvc gr-xxxx. despite numerous others reporting this problem, jvc says its not a recognized problem. i would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs.",0
it is hardly one month old and the pockets on the sides have already started coming off.  it is not the stuff that i expected froma brand name like panasonic,1
not worth the $10 i paid especially when i had to spend $7 to ship it !!,0
"i've had this camera for 2 years and i am glad that it broke so i can (in good conscious) buy a new camera. it is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying ""cheese"". i always thought the battery life was sufficient, and that the quality of the images was fine, but i hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was. i'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click. i actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it, but they said it was functioning normally.it was probably the most disappointing $200 purchase i've made",0
"i bought the 4600 for my parents in 2005. a seal in the lens housing broke in november and we sent it to nikon.  when nikon recieved the camera they said it had ""liquid"" damage to the lens shutter area. my parents didn't send the camera in that condition, yet nikon claims that it is ""impossible"" for that kind of ""accident"" to occur at their facility. two months later i am still arguing with them over this. one of their service represatives, rob mustard, told me (paraphrasing) ""i have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week; i've heard every excuse imaginable for why it isn't the customer's fault."" besides being rude, doesn't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week???? don't buy nikon is my recommendation.",0
"this is an alright camera. if you're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace, or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments, this camera should serve you fine.what i liked about it:1. it's compact, lightweight and easy enough to use2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i've usedwhat i disliked about it:1. it's a bit flimsy to be honest2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon, evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark. even though it has a night landscape option, it doesn't really work.3. the flash causes a horrible delay (but that's been mentioned like 9,000 times before)this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots. i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events",1
i am a nikon fan i have nikon 6t and nikon d50. but about coolpix 4600:all picutures are always blurred or atleast fuzzy. it somehow take decent photos of face and buildings(if they have strong straight edges/stripes),1
"i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months, but i was happy with the picture quality. i replaced it with the s5100, it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 (in particular shutter speed choices) while on a trip to niagara falls, i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt (and i mean slight) after that it wouldn't power up. i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable.",1
i had an s5000 but it dropped it and broke. so i decided to buy this model since i loved the s5000 so much. they took away so many of the great options and quality that the s5000 had...so now i just use a small fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf. it is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control. i would suggest going with the s5000 even with lower megapixels it is much better quality,1
"this frame looks great until you turn it on. the picture quality is less than stellar, but that isn't what annoyed me about this frame. when you buy this frame don't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program. what does that mean you ask? that means that your photos won't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode. you will have 2 black bars on either side of your images; this will not take advantage of the entire frame. if you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame, making peoples faces distorted. i have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation. see below.the build quality of the frame is pretty good. if mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen, this would be a nice little frame.a little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio, but i figured it out. 16:9 stretches the image, making it look distorted. these steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal. i set up a macro in photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse. you will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image. some of your images might be better served one at a time. start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program. 1. go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% (or 788 pixels) this will make the image look distorted. that is ok. 2. then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% (or 591 pixels)            the image is ready to save. you might want to save as in to another folder so youcan go back to your original if needed. 3. copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame",1
this frame is just ok you have to resize all your pictures and the quality is not good at all you are just better off paying the extra $75 and getting the phillip,1
"they say 100% compatible but is not, because is not an info ion-litio, so is not a eqivalent battery, dosn't work. don't expend your money on this stupid batter",0
doesnt work even though the lenmar website says it does. i thought it was a pretty good deal for $26. i wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work,1
"attention! i got this lenmar from amazon. however, it is not compatible with my latest model of sony's dcr-hc96 camcorder! the camcorder warns you to use infolithium battery, and then shuts down. that's it",1
"i purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend.  i will start out by saying that when i first purchased this frame, i loved it.  the display, contrast and brightness were great. however, after 5 short months, the display's pixels started acting funny.  they get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage.  turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it's back to bad pixels.  myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue.  in conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons.",1
"i bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents.  two of them stopped working.  one of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped.  unfortunately, out of the warranty period!  and inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored.i'm out a lot of money for this garbage.  do not waste your money on this garbage!!!!",0
"received as a christmas present, dead by february 24.  well, actually, that's two months.  now all it does is flash an error message, and nothing i do gets it out of that mode.i liked it before it died on me",0
"although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  my pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although i found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  the manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. if not going through the bother of returning it through amazon because i purchased it on line, i would not have kept it.  i actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise i would have given it only one star.  i could have purchased a unit a circuit city or bestbuy and been better off",0
"i purchased this product about 2 months ago, the resolution is not the best but it's acceptable. after a month,it turned off by itself and wouldn't turn on again!! i sent it to repair and had to pay $50.00 !!!somenthing to do with the power button. i have it on a ups with battery, also freezes for no reason. i don't recomend it",0
"i purchased this for my 10 yr old son. i was surprised at how, well, cheap it appeared. we took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first, then it worked for about 10 minutes, then it never worked again and we had to return it. amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly. we ended up buying the dgx 5.1 mp from a local store i it's place. it has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth. not a professional photography instrument, but a pretty decent unit for him",1
"i got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. i feel i was ripped off. the video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. the same goes for the pictures. even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. the audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which i was able to remove with my audio editing software. otherwise, the audio recording and playback were ""acceptable,"" at best. this device is useful only as an audio recorder/mp3 player, and is not really a bargain",1
we have had this camera for about a year.  we wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake.  the picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working. we have a canon powershot a60 as well and have been very happy with the performance.  i would not recommend this polaroid camera to anyone,0
"this camera is a piece of junk. you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture. and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out. not to mention the battery life is horrible. i got a 1 gb memory card so i could take lots of pictures, but the battery runs out after i took about 10. so all in all, if you're considering buying this thing, save the money and frustration and just don't",1
"the picture quality is okay, but the battery life is horrible",0
"do not buy this camera, i repeat do not buy this camera! just read the reviews and you'll know exactly what i mean. lucky i got this piece of junk for christmas, so i didn't spend a dime on it. i opened the package before reading any reviews. now i wish i've read the reviews before opening the box. i don't care what setting you use, i tried them all and i have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera. the lighting sucks, you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones. i really wanted this camera to work, it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures.",1
"i purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. it isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera! she had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. this camera looked like it would fit the bill. it was small and ""cool"" looking, had a dock (great idea), li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (we are not always outside in the sun!) if they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable.save yourself the grief and buy something else. i'm getting a 5mp hp (for less money even!",1
the battery looked like a second hand battery signs of leakbattery poles discoloured.  out of country on holiday will return item on retur,1
"loved the concept of this camera...small, 10x zoom and sleek looking, but the first one lasted 3 days, had it replaced and the second one lasted 1 week.   both stopped operating completely.  so given that kind of problem i do not recommend this camera",0
broke the day after i got it. but when it worked i loved it,1
"i bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars.  i have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit.  the set i received did not have the extention straps included.  the harness was the same as all the other harnesses i could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back.  if you are buying these because of the extention straps, you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars.  they were well made, just not the same item as shown in the picture",1
this item was offered as a suggested accessory to the nikon monarch atb 8x42 waterproof binoculars that i purchased.  i later also purchased the 12x42 binoculars.  this harness can not be attached to either pair of binoculars!  the hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars.other than that the harness is a well made quality product,1
"i have had several people take my pictures.at first,everything is fine.the pictures are ok.the next day,my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.it is soooo blury.then it got 2 the point where every picture i took was blury.i tried fixing it online(like on the program for the camera)and it would not work.i hate this camera!!! not to mention the battery sucks.it lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours.this camera should be $99.00.trust me people......if i could rate this thing at a zero i would.it is not worth it.however,a camera i absolutely love is the sony cybershot dsct5.an awesome little camera",1
"it's not an item to write home about.  final picture quality is usually ok but not spectacular.  the wi-fi works some days, mostly not.  if i'd known then what i know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser.",0
"i've owned this camera a little over a year. it was my 2nd digital camera. it always had focus issues in low-light. i thought it was me, but after working extensively with the manual, after i finally had some time, i discovered that it was the camera. you really need a tripod for those low-light shots. i wasn't able to return it, so i've taken hundreds of pictures with it. it takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen. however, the lens will no longer contract and i get an error message that is unresolvable unless i pay at least $170. i'm just going to get a better quality camera. i will not buy sony again",1
"this tripod seemed to be very nice...  until we tried to extend the legs all of the way.  two and a half of the legs worked well, the third had a section that would not stay extended.  the locking devices are pretty poor.  they are made of a cheap plastic and i believe that even the ones that do work well now, will not last very long with even moderate use.  next time i will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock",1
"it's a great concept, but my unit wasn't recognized by any of my 3 pc's, despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit. one of my pcs runs xp (they had no idea why this computer didn't recognize the magpix) and the others run win98 (which they said sometimes has problems with the magpix, although they don't say that in their marketing literature). they gave me my money back, but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised, and in addition i wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them. i suggest waiting for the next version, or even better, for a better company to introduce a similar product",1
"i purchased the wp-dc700 underwater case for my a70 and followed the directions exactly, oiling the gasket and cleaning it after each use. it leaked and ruined my month old camera. customer service was rude, blamed me and then tried to bargain with me to fix it for $190 instead of the $280 that they initially requested. the underwater case has a 7 day waranty and the camera is not covered for water damage. my father had a similar problem with his $1000 nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason, they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $500. so beware of bad customer service. canon's customer service has all bad unreasolved reviews at the better business burea",0
"very disappointed in this product and amazon's response to the problem.item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until i complained that it was not included,  this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed.they have told me they can't supply the missing part  (the metal neck strap showing in the photo) as item comes from a freight forwarder.    i did not get what i paid for and unable to return  because item has been forward shipped out of the country",0
"the adorama silica gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it. i emailed customer service at adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond. i can't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready. what color should it be and what color should indicate recharging. how to i recharge it? nothing tells me how to recharge it. so far, money wasted. unresponsive to my emails",0

"the main reason for buying this camera is to be able to take good pictures from far away. the quality is very poor. the unit is very bulky to carry around your neck. the sd card slot has some block in it. i was not able to even insert an sd card. all in all, not satisfied at all",0
"the camera is just plain cheap. takes nothing but fuzzy, low resolution pictures. the thing weighs a ton and even for all that the binoculars are only mediocre. a great idea, maybe someday someone will actually do it right",1
this is a terrible product:  1.  the binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use.  2.  the pictures are extremely poor.  3. the company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient.  w,0
"i bought the meade captureview 8x42 1.3mp digital camera binocular. the first one had software / hardware that hung up after 3 pictures, the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable, the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box.a truely tatty product",0
"i read all the reviews and comments on this kodak printer i could find. many gave glowing reviews. i'd just purchased a new kodak digital camera, and thought this printer dock would make a perfect setup. i was never able to get the printer to perform as kodak says it should. it caused some odd conflict, and my computer would not boot into windows xp with the printer attached to the computer. i ended up having to disconnect the printer, turn on my computer, and then reconnect the printer in order to use it. windows then had to always reinstall the printer drivers. it was made even more frustrating by kodak's tech support. i called and emailed multiple times for assistance. in one conversation i was literally told ""i don't know what's wrong and can't help you."" now that's tech support!finally the printer refused to print telling me that it was out of paper. i tried all kodak's remedies, none worked. no matter how much or how little paper was in the machine, it said there was no paper. i even opened a fresh pack to find it still fussy and not let me print.i can't recommend this printer. i could give a better recommendation had kodak itself, through its tech support, at least have provided my with some competent assistance. i got about 2 dozen prints, quite a large cost for printer and supplies for a few prints before the machine just failed to work at all.about the only positive i can give is that the prints i did get looked good, the color was nice. i gave it an extra star for print quality alone.kodak was a name that had some strength behind the name once upon a time. it was synonymous with home photography once upon a time. they've lost something over the years, and that is quality",1
"i will start off by saying, i loved my sony cybershot.  when the alpha came out i couldn't wait to get one.it died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through south america.amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. i've spent 3 hours so far dealing with sony.  most people i spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to business support, computers, video.  they also contradicted one another.when i did get to someone who knew the product i was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.now i am stuck with a lemon, and i fear i have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.i highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  other people have had problems with the camera, i ignored them because i had faith in sony and thought the other alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.if you decide to purchase anyway, i highly recommend you do not buy through amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  places like microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  i am kicking myself because amazon was $100 cheaper then microcenter.  penny wise pound foolish.i love amazon, but, i will never buy anything other than books and dvds from them.  lesson learned on electronics.",1

fuji fails to honor warrantee - don't buy from themdo not buy the fuji digital camera. they charged me $[...] for a fix within the warrantee period. their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears. rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee.[...,0

"the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  i brought them home and there is fog inside.  also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  i called bushnell's help line and they told me...""well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally""  when asked about the stuff on the inside.  ""that is probably fungus, that sometimes happens""  i just bought the binoculars!!!  he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.avoid these at all costs!!!  they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck",0
"i read other review, and decided to give it a try. as soon as i recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, i realized this was a mistake. cheap quality binocular with ""high power"" being a selling point. it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. you will be constantly ajdusting the focus. your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. indeed strap, case, lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all on~! i am taking this back, and buying made in japan ""nikon eagle view"" 100 times better. you get what you pay for~!!!!!",0
"in my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.  my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended.  i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate",1
"i'm going to be completely honest with you. i hated the hp camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. i've had an old hp camera and i have had this newer hp camera and they are all the same. it doesnt seem like it really matters what mp they are. still bur's out and it is disappointing. i guess it really depends on the person about this camera but i'd rather have a sony, samsung, or some other company's item. =",0
"i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years. i was extremely happy with my olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting. this camera was such a disappointment. just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it. (this only happened when using the flash. i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. the first digital camera i ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! the store i bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy. so, i sold the camera and took a $100 loss. i'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera",1
"there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website.  ""if there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  however, this is not a malfunction.""  read:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  sony does not think this is a problem.  it is a design flaw.if you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!",1
"i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago.  i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""digital voice editor"".  sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  only patches of the software are available to download.the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  think twice before making your buying decision.",0
"this is an awesome little camera.  except that you can't use it at night!  there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  it's a known problem [...]also, it's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology.  as a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of usb??!!), and you have to buy a sony memory stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  on the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.but other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  the lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as i could tell, quality was good.in the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??",1
i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame. i returned it,0
"this is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures.  and it takes wonderful video. the downloading is easy and in general it's a ""fine"" camera.  however....the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare.  it's constantly over exposing every subject.  i find it practically un-usable.  the only way i can get the image i'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the iso to 800.  if it had a 1600 iso i wouldn't need the flash at all practically but it doesn't offer that.  the other thing i don't like that i didn't realize i wouldn't like is that it doesn't have it's own cradle in which to charge the batteries.  the batteries have to be removed and charged seperately.  doesn't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it.  the batteries lose their charge even when the camera isn't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice.  intensely dissatisfying.  this camera also has a really long delay from pushing the button to taking the picture.  this results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces.  i know that most digitals have a delay but this one is epic.  i am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a canon.  i am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my canon 5d.  but since this was rated camera of the year by american photo (a publication i trust implicitly), i decided to stray from my canon.  bad idea.  i'm going right to a powershot.  do not pass go.  do not collect $200.  i reccommend you do the same.",0

"we bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all ""eurocam"" for an upcoming trip to europe. it promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip. sadly, the camera is not up to filling this role. we will need to take another camera along with it. however, we will take the v705 for its wide-angle lens, the reason that we picked this model in the first place. it is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review.the need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera. if you do not need a 23mm lens, or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens, then you do not need this otherwise mediocre p&s (point and shoot) camera. good: fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens; the 23mm is the default lens; rapid start-up time; internal focus and zoom; chromatic aberration well controlled; can use 4gb cards; freeze-frame and extract any video frame.mediocre: soft images; perceptible shutter lag; slow shot-to-shot times; exposure compensation is easy, but steps are too small for digital, and is reset when camera turned off; flash does not come close to covering the 23mm; image numbering basically limited to 4 digits; flimsy construction; no manual controls; no raw format; no optical viewfinder; histogram on display, but too small to be useful.bad: the absolute worst menu system to be found on a camera; excessive and unadjustable jpeg compression; poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery; unacceptable visual noise starting at asa-400; forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images, with inability to save the individual panoramic shots; panoramic component images forced to 5mp; overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image (even with display on `bright'); mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results.synopsis:if you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot, this, and the older v570, are the only choices.if most of your images are in bright light, the 7mp v705 gives better images. if most images will be in low light, the older, cheaper, 5mp v570 is the better choice. the camera seems very fragile. treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance. if you chose this as your sole camera, you will likely be unhappy with your choice.the only reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens. = = = = =  some expanded comments  = = = = =twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens. this lens has almost decent optical quality; though the camera's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it. on power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens, which is ideal for us. however, considering that this is truly a specialty lens, it would make more sense that the `normal' lens should be the default. best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens. better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens.the camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction. this works fairly well, at the cost of even more image softness, but even-so, barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length. this in-camera correction can be turned off. doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance.however, being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is. the only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as:  manual settings, a physically larger sensor chip, raw image files, or, at least, a choice of degree of jpeg compression.at the other end of the camera's focal length the 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion. there are very few circumstances where one would want to use `digital zoom', so, as with all digicams, the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus. after reaching optical zoom limits, one is much better off doing any further 'zooming' in an editing program.kodak's advertised ""5x optical zoom"" is, at best, misleading. actually, it is just flat out untrue. the camera has two lenses. the only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens, which is not quite 3:1. the wide angle lens has a fixed focal length. (note, in some places kodak claims 39-114, in others 39-117 optical zoom.) also misleading is the claimed ""anti-blur technology."" as best i can tell from looking at the images, and at the exif metadata, all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa. certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera.speaking of asa. this is an opportune time to address the camera's incredibly poor menu system. it is byzantine: being both awkward and time consuming to use. to adduce, `auto' asa ranges from 50-200, to set a faster (or to lock in at a slower) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels. to change from `auto' to the next fastest (400) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls! on either of the other two p&ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control. the menu system is next to unusable in the field.still on asa settings, the camera does have sensitivities up to asa/iso 1000 (though the manual only documents asas up to 800, 1000 is available on the camera). unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime, will never-happen-again moment, then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying. at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5"".the previous version of this camera, v570, had only 5mp, but the same sensor size. by increasing the pixel count, but not the physical size of the sensor, the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor. this has happened with many of the current p&s cameras, as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality.  my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp, as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact.another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which, when calibrated to the sensor in the camera, allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise. doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10"" prints at asa 800. if one really wants to get carried away, combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography (where dozens/hundreds/thousands of images are averaged together) makes 8x10's at asa 1000 doable. people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak's target market.back to earth.the v705's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p&s cameras. mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression, which is not adjustable (e.g. `best', `good', etc). my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used. this results in small files, with a lot of compression artifact. the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5mb in size, those from another 7mp p&s i have are 5-6mb. my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb. the more the compression, the worse the image. most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point. kodak picks it for you, and picks poorly.the v705's video performance is very disappointing. it uses mpeg-4 compression, and at very aggressive compression settings. unless it is a video of your baby's first steps, or aliens landing in the backyard, you will likely find it hard to watch. the total output datastream is about 0.5 mbs. compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs (total, adding sound, error correction, and time codes, is 36 mbs). better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression, but decent enough (tv quality) videos. that is the choice that most manufactures have made. as a result, the videos from my other p&ss have about a 2 mbs datastream, and so are of much better quality.the battery. kodak's claim is 150 still images per charge. i am getting 100-120, with minimal use of flash and the lcd on `energy saver'. even 150 would be poor, compared with my other digital p&ss, where i expect at least 200, and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management. this camera has a proprietary (and hard to remove) 720 mah battery. my (several) other, p&ss have 790-1120 mah batteries, and, i suspect, more efficient processors.since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle, the battery will likely last most of a day. we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera.though the body is of aluminum, the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two. the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use; there is no cover for the charge socket. the media door often dislodges open.truly, my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used: that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the (not included in this model) ""easyshare"" dock system. this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory, and the overly aggressive jpeg compression.shutter lag, the b? noire of digital cameras, is very evident with this model. i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter, and the image being recorded. however, based on over 50 years of tripping shutters, it clearly varies, and i estimate is, at best 1/4  second, up to a bit over 1/2 second. in addition to the shutter lag, there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens. together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment, an active child at a particular instant, or a wary animal almost impossible. the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation/price p&s cameras from other makers.the accompanying `manual' is poorly organized, childishly written. ""finish reading this book, so you can take and share your best pictures!""  at best, it was written for 8 year olds.the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the `full manual', however the address given is incorrect. when eventually found, the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level.panoramics, one of the advertising points of the camera, are another disappointment. basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in `panoramic mode', each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image, in order to allow alignment. as with most `panoramic modes' focus and exposure is locked on the first image. so far, this is all ok; however, it rapidly goes downhill.first, the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 (not 7) mp. next, the image overlay is so dark that, even with the lcd set at max brightness, it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements.however, it gets worse.the images must be joined in-camera! the individual images cannot be stored! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry. aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2"" lcd in the field gives, in spite of the camera's best efforts, much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger, and higher quality, computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home.the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment, and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills, making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings. of course, my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera, so we will not be dragging it along. you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production. much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved.reading back through this review, i see that it is mostly negative. this makes sense, for, as i disclosed at the beginning, it was my disappointment in this camera's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place. likely i have said all that needs to be said.so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens.  except for this unique lens, the camera's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p&s cameras currently on the market.if you need a true wide-angle p&s, you need this camera. otherwise forget it",1
"i love everything about this camera but....the display is very touchy. i only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke. i had it in a case and must have bumped it just right. my display shattered. mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of. this is not covered under your warranty. my camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet. so i am sitting here with no camera, which is really bothersome since i love taking pictures. i figured i would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen! so i highly recommend this camera but you must be very very careful with it!",1
"i ordered a case for my kodak dx6490 digital camera from antonline thru amazon but received a case that is inches too small for my camera.  if the numbers referenced above show in the review, you can see that my model of camera does not appear.  in spite of this antoline has refused to issue an rma for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if i return without their rma. they tell me it cannot be sold as new since it was opened.  the only packaging was a brown padded envelope.  is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it? i guess i could go to the airport and put it through the screener.there is a little tag on the case that reads dx6490 but it obviously is not since the size is incorrect in height, depth and width and my number does not appear on their invoice. when i checked kodak online, the dimensions for my camera case were larger in all three dimensions.amazon is attempting to resolve the matter but as yet have no feed back from them either. at this point i would never patronize antoline again",1
the magnetic clasp is weak very weak - making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it's own.  i keep this camera case inside of my purse. i wouldn't recommend this product there has to be something better,0
"this was a terrible purchase on my part.  it doesn't even deserve 1 star.  i just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky.  the bag was too small for my z7590, and i paid $8 shipping plus return shipping.  i only hope they don't charge me a re-stocking fee. i went to walmart, found a cute little bag in the electronics dept. that the camera fits great in, with room for the strap and extra memory cards or battery if necessary.  they have cute ones for ladies too, with pink polka dots or stripes inside!  for only $12.  next time, i'll be smarter!",1
i purchased this for my daughter since i had already had purchased one for myself.  the pictures are clear and crisp.  if i had to buy another i would purchase the same,1
"loved this camera the first month or so that i owned it.  two years later my feelings are very different.  batteries need to be recharged constantly.  camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour.  all i can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying.  zoom is worthless, pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated.  flash is also way too bright, half of my pictures are annoyingly ""white"" looking because of this.  definitely going with canon on my next purchase",1
"i too, loved the camera, despite the small lcd screen size, until it got the infamous white screen of death that this particular camera is known for, which usually occurs after the warranty expires (1 year).  photos outside are great, poor low-light photos though, but i paid $100 for it (and with $20 coupon it was $80).  small lcd screen means that it takes less battery power, so the rechargeable aa batteries lasted a long time.  white screen of death temporary solution:  turn the camera off, and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the ""cybershot"" logo on the front of the camera.  then turn it back on.  repeat if necessary.  it'll probably happen again, but it beats buying a brand new camera if you're on vacation and don't have time to bargain shop",0
"like others, mine will review pictures but shuts off almost immediately when in i turn it on in still mode. bought in december 2005, it is now not working.  it is scandalous that so many of us have the same issue and sony is not addressing it. sony should be forced to recall these cameras.",0
"the cybershot dscs40 was bought as a christmas gift for my daughter in 2005.  a few days after christmas 2006, the camera ceased functioning.  because the camera was shipped in november 2005, sony refused to honor the one year warrantee and the repair price was given as $111.  needless to say, we will not be purchasing another sony product in the future",1
i loved my 4.1mp sony cypershot i got for christmas in 2005. then a few days after christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it. if i would tap the camera they would go away. but then a few days later i was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working. it would turn on but then shut off. i had this problem before with low batteries but i changed them and it still didn't work. it would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out. so many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use. so sad camera dea,0
"ok, this camera was inexpensive so i bought it for my kid for christmas (2005).  it actually took better pictures than my other camera (other model sony cyber-shot), so i didn't give it to my kid, i kept it.  i bought it a few weeks before christmas, it was opened and used on christmas day. i just used it days ago, and it just did the thing where it starts turning on, then immediately shuts off.  it has been less than 1 year of use, but a week over 1 year from purchase.  sony wants to charge me $111 and change, to fix it (the camera was less than that when i bought it).  i was just using the camera and it just shut off!  i searched inet to find many other people experience same issue.  this camera is disposable!!!!  i took my extra 256mb chip out of it to put in my other sony camera, and my wife said you can't see the screen (lcd screen) and you couldn't for a long time.  the other camera has the same issue many other people complain of as well.  i also have 2 different model sony dvd writers for computer which are malfunctioning, and a sony vega 36"" tv which isn't worth the money. i will never buy another sony product again!",0
"as the previous reviewer pointed out, this is not the klic-5001 1700 mah battery as described in the product details, it is the lower capacity (1050 mah) klic-5000. at least it is the kodak battery, if that matters to you.

"i purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine. when i saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images, i was embarassed that i had given such an inferior item as a gift.  perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution, but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels.i would not recommend this item at all",0

"i got to get it off my chest.  this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful.  but, the camera has several down sides:   1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time.  this is a pain.  2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash.  forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.   3. not durable.  i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all.  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable.  any suggestions???",1
if you lose this cord just get a flash card reader. it's cheaper and more practical,0
"i'm sure that if the camera worked properly, it would have been fantastic; however, i received a camera on my birthday this year, only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism.  i took 4 blurry shots of my son's birthday party, and the next time i turned the camera on, the lcd screen was broken.  we purchased the extended warranty from best buy, so when i brought the camera (10 days old, mind you) in for repair, they insisted that i'd dropped it and broken it (which i hadn't), even though there were no signs of external damage...no scratches, dents or anything.  after sending it in, best buy informed me that it would cost us $180 to fix, and that they wouldn't fix the focussing mechanism until i'd paid for the lcd screen to be fixed.  disgusted, i retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed.  i contacted sony, who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair.  i ended up receiving a call from their repair center, informing me that it would cost me $180 to repair and that lcd screens are not covered, whether i received it broken or not.  i tried a third time for repair, only to be told that i would have to pay.  my mother tried to use her buyer's protection plan from her visa (it was a birthday gift from her to me), only to have her money refunded, then re-charged months later when best buy's legal department wouldn't pay her visa bill.based upon our experiences (among other bad experiences with best buy), we stopped shopping at best buy, and now own a lovely olympus camera.  don't buy the sony cybershot dsc-t9",1

"i was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review. it's lightweight but sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble, and very adjustable. i used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted, like a short tripod, and it was wonderful. it's also nicely finished, and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs, it stays together and doesn't flop around while you're toting it. unfortunately, that evening i had trouble docking our new sony camcorder, and when i looked at the bottom of the camcorder, i saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera! to my great relief, i was able to pull out the pin with no trouble, but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes. i was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod, so this is not ""consumer error.""

this is first canon product that has disappointed me with its quality. they must acquire them from their chinese supplier for about 98 cents. this plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position. i bought it to use with the canon 250d close-up lens and it's barely adequate for that function. canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks.,0
i had jvc product and some of my friends too. these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem. even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly. price may be less buy its not worth for long run. i feel sony and canon are better than jvc. even hitachi is good,1
"i purchased this camera from amazon recently.  the first time around, the camera tape door wouldn't shut the very first time i opened it.  i returned the camera and amazon was great about replcing it promptly.  the second time around, the dv port worked once, and only once.  there's a short in it.  there is a reason this camera is so cheap.  it's j u n k!!  i will add that a friend of mine is on her second jvc as well.  a fact i did not know until all of this came about.  for two stars, i'll say the video quality is good.  the camera battery does hold a full 60 min. charge.  i had no sound issues what so ever.  background noise?? none here.as for still pictures, if you don't know what you're doing as far as shutter speeds, back light, etc. forget it.  the still pictures are very grainy.  if you want professional looking stills, do not buy a camcorder for this purpose.jvc tech support is useless.camcorder comes with a usb wire to upload still only.  as on any digital camcorders, you cannot upload video in real time on a usb port.  you need a firewire.  this does not come with one.  also, you need to check if you have a firewire port on your computer.i paid app. $25 dollars here on amazon including shipping, for a port and firewire.  it took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower.  it's no big deal.amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time, only refund my money.  this camera is now listed as $30 cheaper than when i bought it last month.  overall, amazon was great about service and return, however, this particular jvc item is junk",1
i've had other digital cameras but this is the first one i've had problems with. i started getting a zoom lens error shortly after i bought it but it would clear if i turned it off then back on. it is now unusable as the lens can not be retracted at all. it lasted 18 months,0
i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame. i returned it,0
"another lense jam problem. the lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket, and the lense extended and jammed. this happened frequently with my old powershot s30 but never caused a problem. canon said the warranty is void because there's a tiny dent on the front and back. they said any physical damage voids the warranty. i complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily. they gave me 20% off the repair",0
"it's unfortunate that with a name like canon, you expect a quality camera.  that's why you shell out the money for an item that you think canon will stand behind.  unfortunately, this is not the case.i bought this camera to use in graduate school (industrial design).  i needed it to do research for my thesis.  i figured between that, all the product photographs, and the need good portfolio pieces, spending the 500.00 on an 8mp camera would be well worth the investment.  i was wrong.about a month after i bought the camera, it started to malfunction.  the lens got stuck and would not come out.  neither would it go all the way back in, so the lens cover would not close (not only putting the lens in danger, but draining the battery as well.)  it was still under warranty, so i sent it to the canon service center in elk grove village, illinois.  it was received, and i was informed that my camera would be returned in 7-10 business days.  that was almost a month and a half ago.i have put my thesis research on hold because i do not have the proper camera for it.  every time i call the service center, i am told that the ""parts are on back order"".  evidently they don't know when these shipments are due in their center, so they don't know when i will have my camera back.  the best part is, when i called two weeks ago, they offered me a ""brand new"" s215.  the told me it was a great deal and that i should accept the offer because ""they never do that"" (meaning they never offer a new camera for one in repair.)  i pointed out that the s215 was only 5mp, had a smaller screen, and cost nearly 300.00 less than my camera.  i also reminded her that my camera was brand new when it broke and i had to send it in.today i was told that there was no information on my camera, the backordered parts, or when they could send my camera back.  the woman on the phone asked me why i didn't accept the s215 that was offered, and when i explained and asked for a camera the same model as mine, she said they were not authorized to do that.  i told her that i was going to spend the time originally set aside for my thesis research to write letters to both the service center and canon corporate headquarters, and she suddenly had a technician she could consult, and my camera would be back to me by the end of the week.  i won't hold my breath, but a copy of this review will be sent to canon.",1
"this s80 used to be the only wide angle compact point and shoot digital camera on the market. it has now been discontinued i'm told. but, we're in luck! there are three other digital point and shoot cameras with a real 28mm wide angle lens! these are: 1) the panasonic dmc-fx01 for $250, and the 2) canon powershot sd800 is for $400. and, 3) the kodak easyshare v570 for about $350.so, you ask, ""who needs a 28mm lens?"" you do! most people concern themselves with how long is their telephoto lens. but, most people who ""know"" know that it is the wide angle lens that is most important---most of the ""best shots"" are made with a wide angle lens. for example, you're in europe and you are trying to ""get a shot"" of that cathedral of notre dame over there. you need a wide angle lens. you are in the california poppy fields and you want to get the expanse of the golden-yellow poppy flowers with the huge blue sky filled with white clouds above---you need a wide angle lens. you are sitting at thanksgiving dinner and you want to take a photo from the foot of the table with everyone sitting on the left and right---you need a wide angle lens. you are in the garden of the california mission and you want to take a photo of the entire garden surrounded by the mission walls---you need a wide angle lens. it's christmas day and you want a photo of the entire group of visitors in front of the christmas tree---you need a wide angle lens. this is where the 28mm lens on this camera comes in! so, you need this camera! otherwise you'll be cutting off heads and leaving aunt sylvia out of the ""christmas group photo"" this year---and she'll disinherit you and as a result of not having a wide angle lens you'll live a life of poverty and misery everafter! :o) if you agree or disagree or know of any other digital point and shoot camera that has a wide angle lens please write, email:boland7214@aol. here's one more wide angle candidate: kodak easyshare v705 7.1mp digital camera with 5x ultra-wide-angle dual-lens optical zoom",1
"i received this camera as a gift and after 15 magical minutes recording with it, i ran into an error message: ""unit in safeguard mode - remove & reattach battery.""  i did what i was told.  several times.  same message.  argh!  (to my husband's chagrin, i read the user's manual completely before using it to avoid such a problem...why is this happening to me?!)  i searched the web looking for a solution, but all i found were perhaps hundreds of people with the same message on similar jvc model camcorders, rendering their cameras unuseable with little help from jvc once their warranty ran out.  luckily i ran into the problem soon enough that we were able to return the product.sure, you might not believe me when i suggest to stay clear of this model.  i'm constantly disregarding amazon reviews that preach ""do not buy this product!"", etc.  that's why i'm suggesting that you please take a minute to search the web for this error message before you buy this product and see if you're still convinced you want it.  suggested search on google: ""jvc camcorder safeguard mode error"".",1
"bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error (appears like the shutter never opens) and will not record video.  spoke with jvc and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in.  will update my rating after i see what is wrong, if they can fix it, if they will stand behind their product.  watch for more details.  before it failed only complaint i had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price",0
"i bought a jvc mini dv just over a year ago. it now does not work. of course, the warranty has now expired and i am out of luck. spent $400 on this model. i do not recommend jvc.",1
"i bought this for my husband for valentine's day, so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy.  unfortunately, the images appeared for one day, and then the unit stopped working.  we had to send the unit back.  i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item.",0
"this is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from.the first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of ""600x."" do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope? nothing but a dim blur. note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. all telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x, the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. the finder is useless; a 6x30 is barely adequate, and this is not even that big.  finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration.  the 1 1/4"" size of the eyepiece is creditable, but too high a mignification for this scope.  and the field of view is in doubt, and don't even think of using the barlow.  buy this scope, and after a few outings, it will most likely sit in the attic.  the review immediately before mine is correct. this is no way to get started in astronomy.in a way, it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope. their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this. in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models. just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys. using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. it is a learned skill. and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. if you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on this website), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8"") dobsonian; celestron's own 6"" starhopper can be found on amazon for under $290.for more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on amazon: ""so you want to buy a telescope.",1
"this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  here's why:1.  the objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  i suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  the planets will appear as very small disks.  one will be able to see saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  2.  the mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  the earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.  3.  the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  the observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  the barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  4.  the mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to ""shiver"", which is very frustrating.  even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.  jim ""konedog"" koenig, astronomy buf",1
"my wife purchased this for me as a christmas present.  it started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months.  i've called digital spectrum, sent faxes and emailed them.  this has been going on for nearly a month.  a real waste of money & my time",0
far better models for similair price range - dissapointed with the quality of the finish etc etc. works fine though.,1
"the plastic stand that holds the frame upright broke immediately. also, be sure to note that there is no memory card. spend the extra money and buy something better. i wish i had",1
i bought this for my wife and she loved it. but it broke after the amazon return policy was up. i contacted the company by email twice and have not heard from them.,0
"i purchased this to display mpeg movies (which it says it can). i was told by tech support that i had to use a divx encoder and that they must be avi (which is also incorrect). the sanyo xacti video camera i was using was mpeg-4 (the ipod accepts the files without issue), i tried converting them in quicktime to several different types of mpeg4 and none worked. there are better frames out there and i intend on finding out which one is the best. i have ordered another brand and will see if it works. this was by first product return on amazon.",1
"have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid.  instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and  error.  after getting best possible settings, main problem is still picture quality: using high quality jpg files as input, photos display with about the visual sharpness of the sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance.  not at all like what i have seen in other digital picture frames.  just arrived from amazon and intended as a v-day gift (tomorrow) for my wife, big disappointment, guess i better make a dash to the florist.",0
this frame was purchased as a gift by a group of us for our babysitter. the idea was great but the frame wasn't. it was difficult to operate and the instructions were difficult to understand. she sent it back and bought one she loves from sam's warehouse.,1
"the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 (and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body).  i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1.  with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  there's also no padding to speak of with this case.  by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.  targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.  apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the panasonic fzs.considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price",1
you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera. the camera does not come close to fitting in this case. the camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case.,1
"even though amazon specifically recommended this bag for the panasonic lumix (dmc-fz20pp) camera, and even though i had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, amazon annoyingly continues to recommend this bag for my camera. to add insult to injury, amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (it took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after i put a large message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories",1
"i owned this sony for a single day before i returned it to amazon.  first off, it records in mpeg2 format which is fairly compressed, and looks it once you upload to your computer.  it is also not natively supported on the mac without a 20$ additional quicktime mpeg2 plugin.  which has to be converted before editing. which makes it a slow, tedious affair.  also, the included software is, surprise, pc only.    other problems, not computer related - the chroma shift in ""night mode"" is intense, making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly.  i'm not expectant of miracles in night modes, but it seems like a simple solution on the production side(sony).  the auto white balance could also use the same attention.  like the previous reviewer pointed out, not a bad camera for the money if you're not serious about editing and you're using a pc.  the lcd touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use.  all in all, i would go for a canon",1
i bought this camera in about february 2005 but didn't know enought about digital to know what i can actually get.  goes through batteries pretty fast.  the recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot.  takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture.  i just thought this was normal for digital cameras till i began reading later reviews.  then i accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface (loose dirt and sawdust)and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on.  contacted hp to get it fix but will cost close to $100 and they will just send a reconditioned one.  so i am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a canon or sony or something besides an hp,0
"i lost my hp r607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. i couldn't fine another r607 (which i really liked), so i purchased the hp m407. i thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...not!! i don't like anything about this camera...it's terrible!  you can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). it says ""auto focus"", but i don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! it takes a really looooooooong time to actually take the picture after you press the button.  i really hate it!  keep looking...don't buy this camera",0
"we bought one of these in the spring of '05. we took it on vacation in july of '05 and the lcd screen blacked out a few days into our vacation. i called hp and was informed that a reconditioned (used) camera was all that i could get. the camera was still under the manufacturers' warranty, but their policy was to replace it with a used camera, not a new one. i had to settle for the ""reconditioned"" camera.  it has been ok since then.  hp's customer service is at best mediocre. there are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep, and since hp has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world, i had a hard time understanding the reps i spoke to. this camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button, which is annoying if you're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot. all in all, disappointing. i will never buy another hp camera",0
"normally i wouldnt write a review, but i have had numerous experiences with this camera that i thought i would share.my sister first bought the camera, and i was amazed with how user friendly it was and i thought the pictures turned out pretty well.  shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage.naturally, i assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck.  i then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after i had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work.and then for christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken.i do accept some responsibility for the damage, i imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit.  but three times? i dont find this to be a coincidence, and i do not reccomend that you risk your money, because you too may have to replace it after 3 months",0
"i have owned this joke of a camera for over a year now, so as someone with alot of experience with it, i advise you not to buy one.  i wouldn't reccomend this camera if it was only $19.95 and came with a free sledgehammer to take your anger out on it when you realize you just wasted twenty bucks...- without buying a memory card, this camera holds a pathetic number of pictures at any setting above vga.- non hp memory cards are incompatible.- it eats up batteries, seriously.- it shuts off without warning for no reason whatsoever.- it will often not recognize rechargable batteries as being rechargable.at this point, i am shopping for a new camera because my m407 claims that brand new batteries are ""depleted"" and shuts off, lovely",1
"this camera is the worst!!!i bought this on black friday there are many reasons why i am returning this piece of junk:1.first of all, it runs on double a batteries2.when i came home i started taking pictures.after i took my first picture, it said error saving image!3.then it worked and it didnt work.i tried downloading some of the pictures that were actually saved on the camera onto  the computer.when i finished downloading them, i looked for the pics on the computer.i f0und them but the pics were all blurry.i was so fed up that i left it sitting on my computer desk for the next 2 months.do not buy this camera,it will be a waste of your money and time!i actually thought hp made good cameras.....-_-",1
"i ordered the sony dcr-dvd108 on april 9.  i still haven't received the camera.  what i have received are 2 e-mails stating that the product is late without any sort explanation why.  as far as i'm concerned it is too late!  the first stated that the shipment would leave on april 16.  when i purchase the camera, i did so because the add stated that if i wanted the camera by april 12, i needed to order it in the next 11 hours and 23 minutes.  this i did.  the next e-mail that arrived just this morning and i've been informed that it will arrive between april 26 and may 3.   i have already missed recording one of my seven year old daughter's gymnastics competitions and now if stick with their delivery dates, i'll be missing 2 more.  well, i'm not missing 2 more and amazon is getting the camera back. the best part of this is that i don't even have the option of canceling the order because amazon is and i quote, ""... preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order cannot be canceled or changed.""  if you can't get the order out on time, you should respect your customer enough to offer cancellation of the shipment or better yet, try some real customer service and have the product shipped from a competitor at your cost.  i can tell you with certainty that sort of customer service would bring your customers for life.",1
"bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page, so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality.  but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one.  in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on, and in good lighting it is barely adequate.  wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory card...should have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer.  you get what you pay for",0
"i only had it for a few hours and after that i knew i would be returning it. its video quality is quite horrible, just better than a videophone and average of a webcam. i should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive. but honestly, i prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is. it's quality will not be any better unless your outside, and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun, this would not do. you basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow. this also is a pain for mac users. it says it's able to import files, and yes it can, but in asf format. now you can play it in vlc, but think you'll be able to convert it, think again. it converts just fine, except without audio. i've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio. so, mac users, pick something else. it is being returned, for certain",1
don't let the product description fool you into thinking it will work with a zr85mc camcorder. it didn't work with mine. it didn't even fit,0
"i ordered the original item, used it for about a week, then sent it to my son in new hampshire.  he used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up, never to function properly again.  i ordered a replacement, checked it out and sent it on to him, with the same result -- less than 15 minutes of use, it quit working.i thought the unit was nice, compact and fairly easy to use, but with two malfunctions in two cameras, i don't think i would recommend this aiptek model to anyone",1
"so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont.then after a week it just stops working.dont get it, theres no flash whatsoeve",0
"hi, i bought this camera and installed the driver from both the cd and then the web.  it caused my computer (a good, modern, fast computer) to crash both times.  the camera worked without interfacing with the computer, but, then, what's the point?  also, the pictures and movies were very grainy and low quality.  the tech support when i had these problems was horrible.  they really didn't stand behind the product at all and to me that's the most important thing!  maybe i could have gotten it to work, but not without some input from aiptek.  i've never written one of these reviews before, but this really got to me.  don't buy this camera is my advice.",0
"i bought this item as a gift, and it ended up becoming mine. i have to say, i am greatly dissatisfied. here are some main issues i am having with the camera:1. it is very poorly designed. the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. buttons are really ugly, and operating the camera is awkward, and for some functions requires both hands to   operate..2. the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally.3. the worst, by far, is the picture quality. colors are just plain terrible. automatic settings are a disaster of photography. i have used a canon (2mp) before getting this one (5mp). the canon was far superior in quality, colors, lighting.. i don't need large files of trash, i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures.as a result, i am strongly recommending getting a different camera. i have had great experiences with canon; and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too. but hp must stop making cameras, and indeed many other devices.",1
"it seems as if every time i want to use the camera, the battery is dead. i find that if i charge it and try to use it the next day, i should expect very much. i'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes, but i shouldn't have to do so",0
"this camera took some great pictures, and i enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  i was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when i was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  the camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  the end.  the lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  this was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  i will not buy hp cameras again",1
"i loved the camera, absolutely loved it.  i was using it one night and it died.  i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened.  the light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  the second time i used it, i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  as i was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.  i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine.",1
"thought i'd died and gone to heaven; this lens was everything i wanted and more.  three weeks after receiving it we went to the grand canyon, and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus - now it does a focus dance, clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus.  it's not my d70, which still works wth other lenses.  this one's going back to it's maker!  if they fix it, i'll revise this review",0
"not only is the physical appearance of this model ugly, it is a complete downgrade. panasonic takes off one of the most important features on the pv gs320 model,a microphone jack! i currently own a 300 model and needed another camera to shoot different angels at the same time, since the 300 is discontinued i purchased the so called upgraded model. now the only available model with mic jack is the vdr 310, and i have heard dvd is quality on camcorders is not what it should be. if you do any video prodcution and need to hook up your camera to a mic, this camera is not for you",0
"i've purchased seven items from amazon in 2005, so i'm not a complete rookie. this item's ad title includes the word ""battery"" in big, bold letters . i purchased this kit advertised with a ""used price"", but ""condition: new"". the ad picture clearly shows a battery. i had looked at several ads and did not read the individual seller's comment ""battery missing"" in uppercase, though in regular font. to me, a missing part warrants more of a warning than a ""comment"". that's my ""lesson learned"", but i still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big, bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing. lesson learned: read the whole ad for the specific seller, especially the ""seller's comments""",0
"this product link needs to be corrected, as the battery contained in the kit is not the same battery which is used in the dcr-dvd7.  do not purchase this accesory kit if you intend to use it for the dcr-dvd7 camera.",1

"this camera looks cool. but it's so, so not cool.the people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves. this is by far one of the worst products i have ever purchased. ever.by the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place. it ""clips"" on... but not for long. the camera's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow. it's complelety unreadable. even with a 150mb card i could only take a few short quality videos. you can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings. and i'm talkin' low quality. worse than any video you've seen online.more problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it. the controls and interface are not intuitive. you'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep. oh, and the earbuds that come with the camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk are huuuuge. they aren't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short. i had the camera in my pocket and when i stood erect, the earphones were violently yanked from my ears. they're obviously intended for oompa-loompas.i'm sure i could have found more problems with this thing, but it eventually died on me for no reason.don't waste your time with this. you will be sorely disappointed. in fact, if i could give this product a rating of-10 stars i would do so. i'm so extremely disappointed with this camera",0
"i paid 99.00 for this little camcorder, thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house, but we couldn't get the videos to transfer to the pc. the menu button would not bring anything up, so overall we just couldn't get this thing to work. a bummer of a christmas present",0
"received the dxg-506v yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount. many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam. this is kind of like false advertising. this is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices (like the optimus that radio shack sells) and there is also no image stabilization. geez, how hard would it have been to put a simple ?inch plastic mount on the bottom. as for sound, the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting. you can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting. that is pretty bad. the resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970's cassette tape recorder.the best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in avi, mov or asx format at different resolutions which is why i got it in the first place. it is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical. it also has a lens cap. my advice to dxg is this. 1.	add a tripod mount.2.	move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that i can use an external microphone. that would be sweet.3.	improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations. the optional settings do nothing to improve this. i tried them all.bottom line is that i would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount. there are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use.",1
"they have made several changes - some good, most bad -  since i bought my last sony handicam in 8/2003.  first of all, there is no carrying strap.  this is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera.  i managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. the docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer, you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. this messes up my editing program.  fortunately i still have my old camera.  the ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge. while i was told most people prefer to use the led screen (i don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) i like to use the viewfinder.  it no longer has a tilt up feature so i end up mashing the battery into my cheek.this last complaint is about the batteries. sony lied about the amount of time that a battery will hold.  the 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. that's slightly more than 3 hours; it is nowhere near 5 hours.  the 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. their packages should be accurate.   all in all, it is not as good as the older product.  there also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed.   this will be my last sony unless they make major improvements",1
"for quite sometime lured by media publicity i thought sony a good brand. but this was not at all true for digital cameras. i bought this p73 for myself and an hp 4 mp camera for my cousin much cheaper than sony. both 3x optical zoom. the hp one was far better in image quality. main problem is that photo quality is not so good. it lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy. this fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a cannon or an hp camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. also, in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom, say 5x or so in other brands. also during video, every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off, another irritating fact.not recommended",1
"i had a kodak camera for years that i absolutely loved.  we took it ice skating and ended up falling on it.  therefore, my family bought me this sony for my b-day and i have to say this is the worst camera i have ever owned.  if you have any movement (such as action shots or small children) the picture always comes out blurry.  what a pain!  also, the picture quality is horrible.  i will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a kodak",0
"this is the worst camera i have ever owned in my life. i had a fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera that took better pictures than this one! i have taken this camera on 2 vacations now, and both times i brought along my olympus slr film camera, and both times, the olympus pictures are clearer, brighter and all but maybe 1 will work, with this stupid sony cybershot, i end up deleting 3/4 of the pictures because they are blury or have all kinds of funny things happening, the only pictures that do work with this camera is during the day time, or in bright lighting. on the first vacation i went on with this camera, my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures, as did my olympus, on the second vacation i returned from today as i write this, i just downloaded my pictures, and deleted 2/3's of them because they are so bad, the ones that came off my film camera are perfect! my sister also has the exact same camera which she brought with her, and as i went through her pictures, same thing over 2/3's of them didn't work, i would have just assumed i'd gotten a defective camera if it was only my sony that did not work, however hers didn't either, i would also assume perhaps it was myself that was the problem, however, i took a number of the exact same picture on this sony as well as my olympus (as a back up and thank god i did) and the pictures from the olympus, as well as every other camera i have ever used, have come out fantastic, on this camera though, they come out horrible, so bad in fact that i'm embarrassed to show people! believe me, if i hadn't gotten it free as a present i'd be writing a nasty letter to sony, as it is though my next camera i'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment, therefore knows what they're doing. sony makes great tv's and home entertainment systems, anything else i've bought from them, or known someone who has, has been junk, their camera, their car stereos, their computers! sony should stick to tv's and home theater, it's what they're good at, camera's not so much, unless you're looking for something cheap that you'd only use in the day, even then i'd recommend a disposable, they even work better than this camera",1
"we had this camera for about a year until on thanksgiving day while out of town it broke.  the lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera.  we ran out to best buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad.  (2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird.)  at first we liked the camera and it took good pictures.  they look great when we got them developed (costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up, super cheap too) and the quality was good.  within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap.  evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems.  inside or outside.  i am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i know one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it.  also the flash quality is horrible.  it takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it's of an object (anything really, just not a person) it comes out pitch black.  inside the lighting is bad too. the camera can never focus and it's just annoying. i also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by sony that for no reason just broke.  one of them broke while in a store getting them developed (in the little machine) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing.  the people said there was no way it was their machine, that it had to be a default in the memory stick.  also the camera is pretty big and clunky.  at the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market, now it is huge!  i am looking into now buying the canon powershot 6.",0
"i have owned several digital cameras, and this is my current digital camera in hands. i would write a short review as a critical person with concentration only on important things to watch for.pros- uses only 2 aa batteries.- battery life is very good.- small camera size. easily fits into a pocket.- can set '+' flash level, which forces camera to make a stronger flash. i use it almost every time.cons- resolution. the images are not sharp in terms of that you can't distinguish individual pixels when looking at the real size picture. i would say, there is no much difference in quality between 4 mp and 50% (1 mp) scaled down version. the same problem exists in sony dsc w1 camera.- i had many problems with ""on"" button. sometimes camera refuses to turn on. it can be fixed by shaking camera and trying again. (it could be a defect in my camera only).- some camera parts are painted plastic, which can be scratched.- camera can lose all settings and preferences if left with discharged batteries (~several hours) or without them at all (10 minutes).- video quality 640x480 is pretty good in high quality mode, but eats flash space very quickly. windows 2000 didn't have the right codec to view the file. i had to install it by myself.- camera is performing slightly below the average in low lighting condition with auto settings",0
"bought the samsung 363 from amazon and it developed mechanical fault while i was test running. making strange noise after loading the tape making it unuseable.about 2 weeks later, i decided to show it to a friend in case it was something unserious and then i realised again that it was not even coming up again. problem with the power system. paralysing it completely (all in less than 3 wks from purchase. left it plugged to charge for 2 days without differenceit's indeed a sad story. that would be my last time of buying a tape camcorder.",1
"i bought this for my 9 year old son to take movies and edit on the pc.  it worked for about 2 days before there was no image from the lens to either the lcd or the viewfinder.  i could see other information on the lcd, such as the date, time, menu, but no image from the screen.  i called samsung and that is where it is now for repairs.  a check of the web indicated that this problem is well documented.  i did try to install the software that came with the camera, but that did not go to well either.  i will retry when i get a working camera again.",0
this needs a lot of light. i returned this do due the lighting/picture quality. the one nice thing about it is you can record decent video quality on a memory card-mpeg 4,1
"the thing is that it is not a very stable camera, hence it does not give you very stable shots, so many of your pics will be blured. even those taken with a tripod. i am a pro photographer, and i would not recommend this camera. yes, it's very thin, but is not worth the pics it takes...seek for other model not so tiny if you're expecting better images",1
"i bought this camera like 7 months ago since it was so small and i liked the design....but the pictures it takes suck, specially in the night time or with flash, you can barely see what you are photographing.the video feature its ok even though you cant change the zoom while making the video, but the design doesnt suit well this feature since the audio-in is in the exact same place where you are suppossed to hold the camera...so most of my videos dont have audio since i was blocking the audio entrace...its small and portable, and i could fit it in any pocket, so thats good, but its so small that the battery lasts only aorund 90 min...that's what it says, but it keep going down like 5times faster than a regular min, so it only does last like 30 min",1
"we bought this camera two years ago.  we have loved using it, until last week.  the camera showed an ""e18"" error in the middle of a special event.  we researched the error online and found that almost anything can cause this error, from turning the camera off while it has a low battery to having something in front of the lens while turning it on.  we're not sure how ours developed the e18 (never dropped or damaged.) our camera has been rendered useless and canon's only response it to have us mail it in for $100 repair",0
"please buy a different camera.  i have owned 5 different pocket digital cameras.  under normal wear and tear, the cannon sd400's lcd screen broke where other cameras i've owned have not.  i just purchased the nikon s7c with a bigger screen that is so well protected that i can hit it with no adverse affect.  if you do buy the sd400, set aside the $150 you'll likely need to replace the lcd",1
"i got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message. i now find out that was a design flaw. anyway, i spent hundreds of dollars on this one, and now, just over a year after i got it, it won't hold a battery charge. i loved both cameras while they worked, but i can't afford a $400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so. i've written to canon tech support. unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge, i'm moving on to another brand camera",1
"i bought this camera to mainly use the digital macro mode, it worked great for several months, now it will not lock focus, this camera is very frustrating, every picture that i take i have to edit to lighten the picture, i tried just about every setting to get the pictures to come out, to no avail, i am a commercial real estate appraiser, so i have taken close to 2000 pictures with this camera, and just about every one i had to lighten, now the macro mode wont work, i will not buy another cannon product ever again!!",0
"i bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and i turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. it was set to automatic flash.  using the auto setting, i thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  i took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused. thinking i hit something and changed a setting, i reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  it will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but i just upgraded to a nikon d50.  i must have known this camera was about to die.even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. i either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  maybe the camera was defective the entire time i had it. no more canons for me",0
"add another e18 error code complaint to the list!  i purchased the camera about a year ago, and have had the e18 error for about the last 2 months.  the camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all, just beep at you and give you an error code e18.  i've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist.  nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots.  canon wants nothing to do with the fix, and estimates repairs between $150 and $200.  save the headaches, and buy another camera from a different manufacturer!",0
here's one more a95 to add to the ever increasing list of e18 failures.thanks to the horror stories from the other posters i'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired. the camera is only about 2 years old... guess i'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits!the camera really performed nicely when it was working... thus the 2 stars. hope you have better luck than me if you get one,1
"i got the dreaded ""e18"" error after owning this (naturally) for just over a year.  repairs will be at least $100, and repairs are only guaranteed for 90 days...even if the exact same problem occurs again!  this is clearly a design flaw (just read how many users had the same problem).  my first photoshot broke after about a year and a half, and since i liked the ease of use and basic design, i chalked it up to bad luck and bought another.  big mistake",0
"i bought my canon a95 in november 2004.  a little after 1 year just after the manufacturer's warranty expired, the infamous e18 error struck.  i called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate, and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling.  i bought the camera for $300 online, now it's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it.  for all i know, it might break down again after the repair! the repair comes with 90-day warranty period, but it could break again after 90 days.  and then... there is an upgrade option.  canon offers a program where you can upgrade a95 for a610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling.  this comes with only 6-month warranty.  again, it could be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires.  i would really do extensive research before buying another canon.",0
"i've had this camera just over a year (figures) and it has gone completely bonkers on me.  sometimes it works and other times it puts black lines across the screen making it useless.  you never know when you turn it on whether it will work or not -- making it completely unreliable.  keep in mind that this camera was used almost entirely inside for my business, so it wasn't abused, dropped, thrown in the bottom of a purse, etc.  it was treated very carefully and probably only shot about 2,000 pictures total.frankly, i'm kind of glad it broke so that i have an excuse to replace it.  here's why:1.  takes beautiful still shots, but forget about any kind of action.  it takes too long between shots to get good action.  it also blurs nearly all the action shots i've ever taken, regardless of what mode it's in.2.  the red-eye is aweful.  it should do better.i doubt that i'll ever buy another canon",1
"this is the worst camera i've ever owned. i'm not exaggerating. i'm so upset for wasting money on it. the only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. it takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. the video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. my friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. it just plain sucks.",0
"junk.  you will get a lens cap error in about a year or so, where it will tell you lens cap is on and you will not be able to record anymore",0
"i thought my jvc digital camera was handy, easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was... then one day at my daughter's ballet show, i turned it on (i made sure i charged it all night) and it wouldn't record.  it kept saying that the lens cap was on.  i am so frustrated and sad.  i spent a good chunk of money on this item and don't know what happened... still don't have a way of recording my daughter's milestones.... don't buy it, if you have other options.",1
the main reason i ordered this kit was for the battery.  when i received it ....no battery included.  i contacted amazon and all they could do was give me a number for sony customer service.  thanks amazon!!,1
"bought the camera, charger and the kit as part of the deal. every thing looks good except the missing npf-50 battery. requested for a replacement.in the replacement kit also battery was missing. returned both the items.59.99 for a carry bag and 3 dvd sis not worth buying this item",0
"i will start off by saying, i loved my sony cybershot.  when the alpha came out i couldn't wait to get one.it died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through south america.amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. i've spent 3 hours so far dealing with sony.  most people i spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to business support, computers, video.  they also contradicted one another.when i did get to someone who knew the product i was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.now i am stuck with a lemon, and i fear i have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.i highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  other people have had problems with the camera, i ignored them because i had faith in sony and thought the other alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.if you decide to purchase anyway, i highly recommend you do not buy through amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  places like microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  i am kicking myself because amazon was $100 cheaper then microcenter.  penny wise pound foolish.i love amazon, but, i will never buy anything other than books and dvds from them.  lesson learned on electronics.",1
"i've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months.  my regular camera is a fuji finepix s602z which is large and bulky, but, takes superb facial shots.  i tried the casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and i'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps i've had that resulted in poor facial quality.  don't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like.  i've just ordered the powershot sd1000 because of the facial detection feature on it.  hopefully, it is better since i don't want to have to carry my bulky fuji to get great facial photos.  i'll review the cannon  once i've had it for a few months",1
this camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box.  one mistake i made was to not take my own sd card to the camera shop and look at the output.  i thought the blurry image i was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera.  i've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this.casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work.  and point and shoot is definately not an option.  i thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping.  i've taken over 200 pictures and i will not print any of them.,1
"i own several great digital cameras. it seems like i get one for each use - one with good zoom, another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others. this one i wanted for the high mp in a small compact size that i can put into my pocket. the first few photos were great, taken outdoors in my sunny patio. then every picture i took after that (same settings - fine, hq, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the lcd screen and the pictures were all washed out. when i download them on the computer, they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white. i've played around with the settings (and i do know how to work them) but still it does the same.so time to return to find a better one. that's too bad since i read some good reviews and wanted to have it",1
return? ha ha!!! you must email them for permission. they don't provide the email address. i have spent untold hours trying to get them to respond. they will do everything to avoid returns. and amazon just looks the other way. don't do it!,1
"after about 2 months of light use, the camera stopped working. also, the output format was very difficult to work with. absolutely will not work on a mac. the price is coming down greatly...i saw it for $88 at target",0
"the is-dv only records videos in the 'asf' format, not mpeg-4.  i bought one from 'egghead.com'.  after 30 days, i contacted aiptek to tell them the problem, they acknowledged that the is-dv only records videos in the 'asf' format.  they said there is nothing they will do about it.  do not buy this product.  aiptek advertises that the is-dv records video in mpeg-4 format, but it doesn't.  'egghead.com' won't deal with me because they say i should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date",0
unfortunately i had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a mac 10.4 program( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a mac.,0
"i tried the trick of resizing, but honestly, the image quality is still abyssmal. the images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out. please, if you're thinking of buying this for someone for christmas this year, choose something else. it might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight, but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like, this will be a huge disappointment.the good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that's almost guaranteed. so put this one on the ""must buy for mom"" list for the 2008 christmas season.i very seldom write a review, and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake i did",1
"i bought this from another retailer on ""black friday"" for half of what amazon is selling it for and i'm still bringing it back.  i think it's horrible.  i was so excited to get a mini-dv camcorder because i heard how great the picture was, but this takes horrible video. it comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything, even using the light.  even in a fairly well-lit room it came out dark.  it looked ok on the lcd screen, but when i hooked it up to the tv, horrible!  and it's not my tv either because i hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine.  i love that it's so small, but if i can't see the video, it's no use to me.  back to by big old sony",0
"the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture. compared to other digital camera's this has presented a problem for the two users i purchased these camera's for. also the flash does not adjust for the correct exposure at protraits within 3 to 5 feet. the pictures are too hot, over exposed and no adjustment works properly.",0
"i have one word for the argus quick clix, horrible. i bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for christmas. the camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them. i was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use. this camera takes horrible pictures. all of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy. when the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject. one very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off. there is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash. you have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use. as stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture, it is so bright that the picture is useless. i would not recommend this camera to anyone",0
"what a pile of junk.  three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture.  if you move at all during that three seconds, the picture is a blurred mess.  even if you don't move, the pictures turn out blurry and dark.  and if you use the flash, you get a lovely white picture of nothing.  i can't believe they sell this thing.",1
"i got for christmas, it was easy to use but only lasted 1 day then the screen does not turn on,,,stay away from this one!",1
"i was happy at first when i got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out.  i was ok with the memory card getting wiped out but when i tried re-formatting the card my phone, computer and laptop couldnt even read the card so i ended up throwing it away.  i guess you really get what you pay for",1
"sd card worked fine for a week.problems arise then worsens over time for one more week then it just doesn't work anymore.  problem is not the pda, nor software on it.  tried to use the card on a separate flash reader/writer.  tried formatting it to fat32, create test directory, data stays on for less than one hour. i would refrain from buying this product.",1
i've never ordered anything and been this disappointed.  i ordered two of these and both didn't work.  i contacted the company's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it.  i tried contacting ritz camera where i purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund.  i am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support.  i will never buy another product from this company again.,0
"my wife got this for me for christmas.  i was thrilled and thought it was a great idea.  i charged the device and transferred pictures to it.  i work in technology, so i agree with many of the other reviewers that the software is terrible -- to delete any photos, you have to delete them from the device, not the software.  image quality is ok, but not good enough to be ""sharing"" with people.  and after a few days of sorting through pictures and transferring and deleting them, it got a bit old.other than looking at it ""straight-on"", nobody on either side of you can see the image.  it's back-lit, which is fine...but it doesn't help much.unfortunately, the battery didn't last all that long.  the device refused to charge after about two months, and eventually it died altogether.  the only way to make the unit work was to plug in the usb cable; the battery would not charge. so i contacted ""support"" and got a basic run-around, telling me that you ""shouldn't charge the battery for more than 2-3 hours"" at a time, and that i could request an rma to return it for replacement.  warranty is no good, and it can't be returned.i'm holding onto it because i'll probably take it apart and use the internal parts to build a desktop ""photocube"", so it can run off the usb cable.but i agree with others that -- even if this worked longer than 2 months -- it's just a novelty that gets tedious quickly",0
"this keychain photo viewer sold by a company called ""smartparts"" is identical to one sold by ""argus.""  neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support.  you buy this, you're on your own.  you seem to be able to find the argus one a little cheaper... though they do mar the front of it with a big, black imprint of their logo.in any case, this thing is maybe worth $20 as a novelty.  don't pay more.  image quality is mediocre and the software, while functional, is stunningly primitive.  if you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations, it's a kind of cute gizmo.  but don't give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy.  check the bargain bins for this thing, or just wait for the next generation device.-- m",1
the battery does not hold up. after 10 months it would not work at all. i thought it was the battery. emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable. i found one and changed it out myself. the unit was just dead. warranty is 60 days. will not buy another one,0
"the idea is wonderful but the window is too small to be useful. i have it, have pictures on it, but never show it to anyone. trying to find the right light to illuminate a tiny picture was ridiculous. easier to show a few pictures in my wallet",1
"i purchased this for my wife for valentine's day. the installation went fine but i have two problems with the device. first, the software to do the picture transfers is awful. you can only select pictures on your computer to download - you can't see what photos are on the device in the software. in order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself. i checked the webpage for updated software - no joy. the crop feature is nice (and well used) but otherwise i feel like i am looking at a windows 3.1 application. second, the image quality on the device is very poor. i didn't have very high expectations, but this was lower than i expected. reminds me of the picture/screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens, maybe a bit worse. you can make out the picture, but not much detail at all. the advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea, it's the only way to get a decent picture.overall, i'm a little disapointed. but then, you get what you pay for..",0
"i was really disappointed in this product.  it worked great when i first got it.  but before the first charge on the batteries wore out it stopped working.  it was more expensive to return it or have it repaired than it was to buy a new camera.  like i said, disappointed",0
"downside: 1. i'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem. the camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems. i switched batteries...let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it...nothing is getting it to work. on top of that i now have a memory card with photos on it that i can't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that.2. not good with indoors pictures especially if you try the ""night"" mode. if you use that mode, even with a tripod, keep your subjects to still-lifes, only...if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest, they will at best be blurry, at worst they will look like double exposures.3. indoors pictures set at normal mode, with or without flash, are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera.upside:1. through its usb cable, it booted right into apple's iphoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that i took a breeze.2. outdoors, with plenty of sunlight, gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise. kodak did well with this aspect of the camera's ability, given the price.3. we won this camera (free) so for me it's almost all upside...except now i have to shell out $$$ for a good camera (that will hopefully read my current memory card",0
"i would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. the picture quality was not good at all. i previously owned another kodak camera with the same megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better. just after a year of using the kodak c300 camera, it stopped working and i did not use it that much. i now own the sony cybershot dsc-w50 that takes great pictures, i haven't had any problems with it and i have been using it on an almost daily basis since may 2006",1
"camera worked great for us for 6 months. easy to use, decent pictures and good software. the battery life was fine for our use. it quit working at six months and would no longer focus and is now useless. for a six month disposable camera its a little expensive.",1
this is a complete waste of money. (1) it's clunky and hard to carry around. (2) not really a good value for money based on the mp's it offers. i would recommend you spend the add'l $50 and get a nicer camera! this one is crap,0
"i gave it two stars because it was great... when it worked.i got it sometime in january, and it lasted until about june.i take good care of my things, so i know its not me.it just suddenly *stopped* working.i'm more than just a little miffed.i've tried getting all different types of batteries-i've tried letting it sit for a while.i've taken it to my friend who works with cameras for a living and had him take it apart and clean it and all sorts of stuff.its dead. i just threw it away",1
horrible camera. barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz.drained the batteries within a few pictures.so not worth more then the cost of a disposable!! sorry kodak...but i'll stick with the good ol' reliable sony,0
"i have had this camera for about a year and a half.  i got so fed up with it that i just bought a new one.  i admit, this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom isn't used.  however, this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used.  i would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera",1
"i'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures.  the p3 was the fourth point and shoot nikon camera my family has owned.  one of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it.  on the p3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on.  i accidently dropped it from about 30"" off the ground when it was only a few days old.  it landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens.  the outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus. i sent it back to nikon and as i expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty.  they charged $162.50 to fix it.  mastercard has a program called ""purchase assurance"" that will hopefully cover the repair cost!  the other night i saw a commercial on tv for an olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet, get wet, or even frozen down to 14 degrees f and still take pictures.  i wish i had seen that ad first.  the nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera.  not buying nikon anymore.",1
amazon replaced the original coolpix p3 because of technical defects but the new one has worst problems. this one does not even focuses at all.i dont know what to do now because there is no technical service for nikon in my country venezuela or latin america. i basicly lost my 300 dollarsplease answe,0
"this was the first digital camera i purchased. i am an adventurous person and  wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle. this camera wasn't it. the good*it is compact, which is pretty convenient*it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy. the bad*after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes, the camera leaked and broke. olympus replaced it, but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over. *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use. rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want. the pictures always need touched up afterwards, sometimes seriously.*the zoom sucks. don't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience.*the image stabilization is a joke. you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren't blurry. *the user manual left me with a lot of questions",1
"here is the short version. oct05 i bought a fujifilm finepix f460 digital camera for $299.99. nov06 camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating bright/dark horizonal strips across them. jan07 i sent the camera in to fujifilm's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~$300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires. jan07 the service center sent me a repair estimate for $70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $85.95 (i spent $16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $102.47 for the repair if i accepted). feb07 i contacted the service center and stated that i think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse. and that i don't think that it makes sense for me to pay $100 to repair a $300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired. the service rep, named christina, asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do. i complied. mar07 fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that i did not reply to the estimate. now i will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera, its memory card, and the shipping i paid.",0
"the worst thing for this is, you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing hd video. i think most of buyers would take hd video if you buy a hd camcorder. but a small disc can only hold 20 min hd video, have to change disc time by time. the cmos sensor is worse than ccd but it is the best sensor among cmos in this price today. a lot of noise will come in low light condition! i bought it for $800 and return it. i think you'd better buy sr1 with a 30g hard drive. that would be a much better one!",1
this product didn't appear to add any appreciable sound benefit; the sound from the ecm-hgz1 appears to be the same as that recorded with the native audio of the camera itself. i wish i had not bought it,1
"we use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations.  the hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations.to test the microphone.  i went to a noisy starbucks, huge lines, moderate music and tons of conversations.  i recorded on the video cameras mics, then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature.  i aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders.  in all instances, there was no difference in sound quality.  i then went to the sony style store in the mall and had her open a different microphone and allowed her to install it. she read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings.  we could not find any difference.  i checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic.  once the mic is attached and turned on, the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic.  i am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera.  many of the new camcorders with hard drives and dvd drives do not have a mic input or active interface shoe.  i would rather want a mic input so that i can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of sony to create one for their shoe.  overall, i am stuck.  if i record something interesting i will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing.  (the camera shots great video",1
"i agree with the previous reviewer. buying, attaching, and using this microphone is a waste of time and effort. save your money and get a good microphone, unless you want your sound track to sound like someone mumbling into a tin can",1
"i realize this is not a true gunshot mic though i had hope. the product presents itself as cheap and i hate to say the results are not good quality.  at this time, i'm the only reviewing customer and i can see i must have been the only guy to buy one of these.  product attaches well and there is a noticable change in the audio.  three settings, zoom (syncs with camcorder's zoom), gun (which maxs the zoom of the mic regardless of video zoom), and off.  i purchased this to make recordings of presentations better.  i know now that i should have just bought a wireless mic for the speaker.  i thought i'd get more use this route",0
"hi,i have had the vdr-d300 for about 6 months now.  i have never gotten a recording session to last more than about 20 min.  the camcorder constantly locks up, usually after about 10 min.  this is on a full battery - the unit never gets even to a battery alarm.  several times the reset button nor the reset proceedure per the manual works.  i must have a faulty unit.  i'm investigating repair.  the unit has a great lens, camera, and video image, but my unit is not stable at all",0
"amazon picture shows an original japanese-produced np-40 with 3.7v and 710mah (just like the one i got with my f810). what i got was a fujifilm-branded chinese-produced np-40 with 3.6v and 750 mah. yes, it works, but it's just obviously cheaper. skepticism is a virtue",1
"this product will only display 142 photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card.  this little fact isn't mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual (hidden from consumer). i initially loaded 1,400 photos onto a 128mb card and was shocked to only see 142 displayed. a firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to 250, but i could never get the file to load into the frame. another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music.  it would have been nice to hear a random music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on. definitely not worth the price. shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback",1

"i bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed.  i sent it into nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty. the repair charge with shipping and tax would be $115.22.i am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused.  battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time i had it. for this reason i would never buy another nikon product again.  next digital camera will charge without removing battery.  camera takes great pictures, but can't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty. bye bye nikon",0
"i was very disappointed in nikon's service.  this camera has a 2in lcd display that apparently is very fragile.  when i returned for service, nikon claimed i dropped it... which i didn't!  i was very careful in handling this camera, but the fragile lcd still broke.  to be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing.  they offered to repair it for $210, nearly the price of a new camera.  i will never by a nikon product again.  if they are going to sell such a fragile product, they should at least include a hard case for it.",0
"i bought this for my husband for valentine's day, so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy.  unfortunately, the images appeared for one day, and then the unit stopped working.  we had to send the unit back.  i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item.",0
"i won this camera in a contest and now i'm kinda wishing i never had.  practically everything i've shot with this thing has turned out bad in some way or another.  from the autofocus that can never decide what it wants to focus on, to the very poor image quality in slightly low lighting situations, to the camera recording glitches in the audio when i capture onto my computer.  i know you may look at this thing and feel like the price is right, but i really suggest you just hold out a little while longer to save up a bit more and buy a canon camera that's not gonna cause you these problems",1
"this is the worst camcorder i've ever owned.the picture quality is the worst.i can't get a clear picture unless i focus at one distance.if i move a little,or something moves in the picture it goes out of focus.i haven't got one decent video with this piece of garbage yet. i recommend panasonic,it was the last camera i owned and every picture was crystal clear.it's my fault i didn't do my research before i bought this",0
"the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 (and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body).  i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1.  with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  there's also no padding to speak of with this case.  by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.  targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.  apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the panasonic fzs.considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price",1

"even though amazon specifically recommended this bag for the panasonic lumix (dmc-fz20pp) camera, and even though i had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, amazon annoyingly continues to recommend this bag for my camera. to add insult to injury, amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (it took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after i put a large message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories",1
"i spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer dv from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. after hours and hours i had to realize that the usb cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. if you don't own a sony vaio (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.link connection, which no other pc/mac has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. i would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way i had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. however i found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""thin fire wire"". the exact same cable (1.8 meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. so check out an apple store near you and save some money.shame on you sony",1
"instead of this pick up a plextor convertor box.  it takes the output of the camcorder (composite/rca or s-video) and compresses that to mpeg-2 (dvd) or mpeg-4 (or divx) and includes software which easily burns that to dvd or cd (mpeg-1 or mini dvd).  look for plextor's m402u box.  unless you really want to deal with 3.125 mb of data per second (25 mbps), or about 180 mb per minute, or about 11 gb per hour through the firewire link, get the m402u.  your options will be greatly expanded, and you won't tell the difference by looking",1

"i bought my kodak v570 less than a year ago. at first the only annoyance i had was the fact that i had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in mov format that made it diffcult to edit. but a few months ago, the focus refused to work properly. in wide angle, it was fine but when i zoomed in, the image was unacceptably blur. i tried every setting, finally gave up and called kodak service. i was asked to mail the camera to sydney from melbourne where i live. a few weeks later, the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it. since i still could not take acceptable pictures, i contacted them again. this time to be told to send pictures via e-mail. i did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images. but the pictures were taken in broad daylight. when i disagreed with the logic of the comment, i was told to call them for a discussion over the phone. but the number they gave me was a fax number. using my resources, i got in touch with technical service by phone. this time i was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright, it's probably due to shaky hands! it's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives. it is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent india trip when many of the pictures turned out blur. now i have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people. there is no way i will ever buy another kodak again. i can recommend it only to my worst enemies. i have now to, again, send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far, i am not holding my breath for answers. still want to buy a kodak? go ahead but don't say i did not warn you. by the way, my other camera is a casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not",0
"i have to say that i really wanted to like this camera. it takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature. it is quite compact and has a nice screen. the software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface.why 2 stars? ok here's the bad stuff:1) in the first shipment i got, the normal mode (non-ultra-wide angle) didn't work. the images were garbled and almost unrecognizable. the ultra-wide images were fine. i attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange. the second v570 i got from amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me. so, i don't think it is just a random problem. there appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that i would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem. my v570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and i use a casio exilim ex-z70. 2) the stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel. you have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle. also, since you have to charge the battery in the camera, you can't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other. for comparison, my new casio ex-z70 has a usb cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger. so, if one battery is dead i can leave it behind in the charger while i take pictures with the spare.3) the movies that you take with this camera are stored in mov format instead of avi or mpeg. while it does play in most pcs if you have installed quicktime, it is not supported by my streaming media player (d-link dsm-320rd) and is difficult to work with in the video editor/dvd creator sw i use (sonic mydvd). i can't say how widely mov is supported compared to avi and mpeg, but that format created problems for me.so, i applaud kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital. but i think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations",1

"terrible product.  printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly.  i've had a replacement sent and the same thing happens.  even though i have printed less than 50 photos with this replacement, which i have had less than a year, kodak support says it cannot be fixed by me and i need to have it serviced by them for 80 bucks.  a new one sells for $99 and the price is dropping fast.  i told kodak support i would not send it back to them, spending 80 dollars would be like flushing money down the toilet or taking a stick in the eye. i further notified kodak that i would instead send it to the place it belongs - a land fill.also, i've heard that the recommended fix (which does not work, by the way), unplugging the unit to reset, will cause the color cartridge light to illuminate prematurely.  with the cost of paper and cartridges, this last insult makes this printer one to avoid.  1 star because when it does print the prints look good, but, man, the aggravation to get this thing to work correctly is not worth any price.  rushed to the market place without enough reliability testing on an unsuspecting public.  total junk from a venerable name desperate for a hit product.",0

"after doing a bunch of research, i bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective sony ccd that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had.  the first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations.  after a few days of that, the camera dies completely.  the second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease.  one camera . . . a fluke maybe.  but two?  that suggests a real problem so beware.",0
"dsc series camera all have a ccd imager defect that will leave screen blank after you use the camera for 2 or 3 years. (do a google search. you will find out what happened.) sony knew this problem years ago. but refuse to fix it. they will wait until the camera fail and then charge you $300 to fix it. that's what happens to my dsc-f717. ever wondering why dell, hp etc all recall sony battery for laptop, but sony did not recall their own laptop battery? sony will never fix their own problem. we the customer have to pay for their mistake.",0
"i bought this in august 2005, when the original battery that came with my nikon coolpix 880 (late 2000) started running down fast.  on the page i ordered from, it appeared to be a genuine nikon battery, however, when i received it, it was not.  it was made in taiwan, and does not have the nikon brand name anywhere on the battery (or packaging, as i remember).  this battery has never held a charge well.  it's about as bad as the original battery is now, and i've only had it a few months.  maybe i just got a lemon--but i'd recommend you buy a genuine nikon, if you can find one",1
"i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. i had looked at swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.these binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. the 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's i've been using. i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because i always used to lose them.for the price, these can't be beat",1
"i bought this camera for myself during christmas 2004.it was suppose to be a utility camera, ebay items and class projects for the kids only--i don't trust digital cameras for family photos.the kodak cx7300 seemed to fit the bill; inexpensive, easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp.the flaw in this camera didn't appear until i pulled it out of the drawer some months later. the camera wouldn't turn on. i checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape. i eventually tried replacing the batteries and, sure enough, that worked.the next time i took out the camera, the exact same thing happened. and the time after that.at first, i thought the cx7300 was eating the batteries. but eventually i came to the conclusion that the camera doesn't eat batteries, it nibbles at them. it won't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries.the kodak batteries that came with the cx7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight, going strong.i contacted kodak about this flaw. they wanted to talk about what kind of batteries i'm using--kodak--or the option of my purchasing a camera dock and some rechargeable batteries. a solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent.i thought that buying an optional ac adapter would be the simple, and cheap, solution. surprise, surprise, the cx7300 is one of the few digital cameras kodak makes that doesn't take one.so, now that i'm way past warranty, what do i do with it?i'm shopping for another camera",1
"i bougt this camera and a olymus camera, both in the same price range, the kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship. avoid this at all cost the olympus was well made, durable, higher quality picture and ease of use",1
"my camera has broken in less than one year of owning it.  because i received it as a gift i don't have the proof of purchase so kodak will not fix my camera for no cost.  what a lemon the cx7300 is.  first of all it takes pictures so delayed you never really get a good candid picture.  what's broken?  i can take one picture before the batteries go dead.  i change the batteries, one picture.  change the batteries again, one picture",0
"i got this camera when it was rather new. i am not extremely pleased with it. it is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it.-first of all...it has no lens cover so you have to keep it in a camera bag. incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined.-it takes for ever to take a picture. you have to wait for like  2 seconds for the picture to be taken.-it eats up batteries like crazy-it takes forever to turn on-if you have the flash setting on autoflash, the camera will still flash in bright sunlight-the pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home-it has no optical zoom (but the zoom is really the customer's choice.",1
"i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times. last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed. i haven't changed anything or done anything. i have no idea what's wrong with the camera, but given the price i'm pretty annoyed and amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days",0
"i've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but i am not having the same experience. the quality of the photos are horrible so i started thinking it was me and i tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, i only get one good shot out of about ten. i have a fuji 4mp that i bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. i bought this so i could give my old one to my daughter but i'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my fuji. we recently had snow here in tucson so i took pictures with mu fuji and compares them to the canon and the 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down. i don't get it, did i get a defective camera or am i doing something wrong or does this camera just suck",0

i am far from an expert however even for an amatuer this lens was horrible. i took about 400 shots with my digital rebel xt and got so frustrated witht the poor quality of the auto focus that i immediately returned it / got a refund. in all but the brightest lighting conditions this lens was extremely slow with the autofocus. in many cases the lens could not focus and continually hunted through it's entire range. since most of my photography is of animals i simply could not wait for the autofocus to work and missed many shots.i tested the autofocus against my canon 18-55 ef-s (packaged with the rebel xt) and a canon 75-300 ef. in every instance where the tamron could not focus the canon lenses had no problem! when the tamron would focus i found the pictures were not as sharp as my canon lenses. again i'm far from an expert however i was only printing 4x6 photos.i replaced the tamron with a quantaray(sigma) 55-200 dc which has proven to have a very good autofocus and great optical quality(for amatuers..) bottom line.. it was hard to part with the tamron because i was really enthused about the zoom range however i would much prefer to use 2 lenses can focus than 1 that doesn't. i have read many reviews with the same problem noted. tamron needs to get thier act together,1
"i loved this camera when i received it and used it a couple of times. then, it just stopped working. i have since purchased the same camera elsewhere and it is works great. maybe this was just a bad egg. good camera, but 2 months of use for the money wasn't good",1

"i originally purchased the samsung duocam scd6040.  it fortunately broke 1 week before the warranty ran out.  the video began having giant pixilated squares when video taping and on playback.  though under warranty, it still cost me $49 (their fee) to send in the camera for a repair.  the repaired camera came back broken.  i had to deal with many customer service people, but finally got them to agree mine was a ""lemon"" and they sent me the scd6550.  now 10 months later, the video and playback on this duocam has broken.  you see a black screen with yellow blocks on the lcd and through the viewfinder.  i cannot video tape or playback anything on tape.  it is not under warranty.  i can't believe their cameras/duocams don't last longer than one year.  they must use cheap parts.  please save yourself the headache and chose another brand.",1
"i thought i was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos i shot indoors i liked the analog better. very poor and grainy.  also the focus is terrible! while filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus.  i filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing.  very disappointed with this purchase.  i guess it's true what they say. ""you get what you pay for""  it seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much",0
"i have many pet peaves about this camera.a) the video showed untrue colors and came out rather dark----don't try to record indoorsb) didn't fit into my hand naturally and had to use two hands to navigate the menu and even the record button. not goodc) didn't start up fast enough---i always missed the shotd) the camera photos aren't of good qualitye) microphone not that great---you couldn't even hear people that were standing ten feet away from the camera.f) if your laptop is over 3 years old, even if you've got windows xp, don't expect the software to be compatible.g) the zoom lens zoomed to fast at the movement of my finger. i'd lightly press the zoom button to one side and it zoomed too fast and it did the same for zooming out. i felt like i had to just manually zoom----ie. walk up closer to the subjecti honestly say stay away from the samsung's and the sony's aren't much better and they have a monopoly on the matching accessories, ie. only sony products are compatible with the camcorder.i finally bought a jvc and they are awesome----the take more light in, better acoustical recording, better zoom function, quicker start up, and lighter. you can even buy the cheapest model (which is pretty much what i've got) and the picture is great! my parents commented on how they thought i must have a camera like the news reporters, as it's the same quality",1
"to add on to the previous reviewers, i was very disappointed with this camera's performance.  i compared the ""5 megapixel"" photos with photos taken with my canon, powershot g3 (4megapixels), and the scd6550 simply did not produce the same quality stills.  the camera itself also seemed flimsy.  the idea of having a two-in-one camera is so attractive.  but another attractive concept, canon's elura50, offered a camcorder with a compact design.  in the end, however, it broke down only after a year and a half.  for a $500 purchase that is not a durable lifespan (cf. reviews for elura50 and you will see that many are having hardware problems).  this camera seemed less durable than the elura50 as i maneuvered the various parts and dials.  of course, i am returning the camera before it can prove its durability.  nevertheless, maybe the folks at cnet can stake their money on it.  lastly, i should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed.  i found that i had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button.  this definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments.again, this camera is a great idea.  but, i suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording.  this one is on the right track, but, still so far from accomplishing a quality product.",1
i would agree with the other review.  the indoor/low light quality of the video is unacceptable.  i will be returning the camcorder today to purchase another,0
"the scd6550 is a great idea, but just doesn't preform as i had hoped.  i was looking for one camera to take on vacation, replacing carrying a 2 year old sony minidv and a 5 mp sony cybershot.  my sony takes 1 mp stills, has excellent video, but @ 1mp, the stills are not nearly print worthy.  this camera is actually smaller and lighter than my sony.the 5mp still camera function gave excellent results, both with flash and with natural light and outside.  shot for shot it produced either as good or better prints (4x6) than the sony cybershot.  digital video is this unit's short coming.  i did identical shots inside and outside with the sony and samsung.  the samsung's video quality was very poor, looked more like analog or standard 8mm quality.  inside, with natural room lighting, it was pretty much unacceptable.  outside, the shots lacked the crispiness of the sony.  i took it back, will keep the sony's and hope that sony comes out with a greater than 2 or 3 mp model soon",1
"these are not pioneer boxes.  these are mbi boxes. i bought them and was very disappointed since i also have bought pioneer boxes before, and when i compared with the mbi, the latter one is much less sturdy and even the index cards are flimpsy compared with the pioneer's.  do not buy these.also, adorama's customer service is very unfriendly in regard to making their customers satisfied.  they insist that they are the same, that i need to return them on my cost, because of their mistake.  they flew from one reason to another with blame from that they have never carried pioneer products, to amazon's mistake in naming them pioneer.  but then their own website also has named them pioneer.  anyway, just reconsider about buying any products from this company. it's not worth it, considering the shipping is outrageously high.  it is my honest opinion.",0
"i have to agree with the other reviews of this scope.  i purchased this scope as a christmas gift.  when i opened it, the equatorial mount (the basis for the entire scope) was broken.  i contacted celestron and was promised another part for it, which never arrived.  i contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me.  it didn't fit.  finally, i was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope.  the equatorial mount was in 1 piece.. yeah!  too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and i could not assemble this one. i even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support (who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived) and all i got was a bunch of excuses.i finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one entire telescope.  it's february and i just now have a product that works.  (i haven't had time to try it though!)  celestron offered no refunds for this telescope, so buyer beware.  if they are not willing to satisfy customers, your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells. good luck",1
"first off, many of these reviews address the actual use with this telescope....i cannot even comment on how well this telecope works because the two that were sent to me were broken!i ordered well before christmas as a gift for my son...but to be his big gift from santa claus.  my husband opened the telescope up late christmas eve to put it together and have it ready in front of the christmas tree and right away it was clear that this telescope was broken.  the 2 mounting screws were  bent, very bent.  this puts you in quite a position when it needs to be up and ready for your child.after a whole lot of effort with amazon's customer service (from another country!) they sent a replacement...to the wrong address!!  (long story that i will not bore you with.)when the 2nd telescope arrived my husband once again opens it up and guess what?  they same screws were again bent.  the box on the outside was not damaged, but something is not working for them.i am so disapointed with them.  this was the first time i had purchased something this big from amazon.  i have mainly done music and movies, small stuff. after this experience i will no longer buy a big ticket item that would have the possibility of damage.  it's just not worth the headache and problems, not to mention disapointment, to my son.  i would proceed with caution when ordering this item from amazon.  if you get a broken one...you just might be receiving the 2 i have had to return",0
"this is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against.the first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x. do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope? nothing but a dim blur. note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. all telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x,  increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. the finder is useless, smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30.  finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating.  the low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope, depending on its design and field of view.  that the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing.  and don't even think of using the 4mm (high power) eyepiece or the barlow.  i do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners.  their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography, and for this they require careful setup.  the equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress na? buyers with its complex ""scientific"" appearance.  in a way, it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope.  their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. it is a learned skill. and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. if you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8"") dobsonian; celestron's own 6"" starhopper can be found on amazon for under $290.for more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on amazon: ""so you want to buy a telescope.",1
"this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  here's why:1.  the objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  i suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  the planets will appear as very small disks.  one will be able to see saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  2.  the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  the observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  the barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  3.  the mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to ""shiver"", which is very frustrating.  even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.  jim ""konedog"" koenig, astronomy buf",1
"my ownership of this camera was brief.  first, you must know i love nikon.  i have 2 other nikons--an old cooplix 2200 and a coolpix 5700.  they have wonderful lenses and give great pix.  i thought my experience with this model would be similar.  not!~  from picture numero uno, the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate.  i got pictures, yes, but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens.  what a dissappointment!  i traded it in for a canon a520 and am happy with that camera.  i suppose it is just what it is.  if i'd saved and spent a lot more money on a d50 or rebel, who knows?  anyway,  that is my sad tale with the nikon 4800",1
not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on. i would turn it off and on and nothing would help. finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in. this seemed to fix the problem a few times. after that i thought it was just operator error. but it wasn't. the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile. an event came up about a month later. i got my camera and tried to turn it on. nothing happened. so i changed the batteries. still nothing happened. i'm not sure what happened. i do believe i purchased a lemon camera. i'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung. it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. so i guess you get what you pay for!,0
"so this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. i go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. it would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. alarmed, i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again.but that was only one thing wrong with it. this is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. it woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. you can't trust this camera. you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute!",0
"i guess i really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of crap",1
"i purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. i would not recommend this camera.",0
i agree with the two previous reviewers.  there needs to be a user manual and there isn't one.  the fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees.  this isn't very helpful for star gazing.  the maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches.  this is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together,0
"on reciept of the tripod, i found it wrapped and packed (on the outside)in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product.  when i opened the box, i found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box.  there was minimal packing around the tripod itself, mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching, and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around.  i have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping.  also, if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company, instructions are not part of their package",1
i ordered this product from amazon.com and when it arrived i fully charged the batteries.  when i went to use them they were dead.  i charged them again and when i went to use them a few days later the batteries were dead again! i want my money back,0
"i own the olympus fe-100 digital camera, and it came with unchargeable batteries (oxyride). i switched to energizer batteries and bought an energizer 4-battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas. it's not a quick charger like this one, but i say for less than half the investment, i've got a charger that does the job. i would not spend this kind of money on a charger. so i say, if you're part of the ""gotta have it now"" generation, you definitely pay for convenience. otherwise, charge your batteries more slowly (2-3 hours) and save a lot of money",1
two months. . .the amount of time in which i saved to purchase what i thought was an 8 megapixel camera for a steal. . .one week. . .to find that no matter what i tried i was utterly dissapointed. . .1)no matter the setting every picture is drowned out by the flash and withouth the flash the picture is nothing more than i horrible blur.2)the 5 minute 2 time flash is horrible. . .every person i try to get a picture of thinks it has taken the picture before the final flash even goes off resulting in 90% horrible family photos. i could go on but i wont. . .i cant even stress my dissapointment in my waste of money. . .there is a reason that it is not the bestselling camera on amazon. . .because it is not worth it.i now have to save up for another and hopefully pawn this off on someone with less expectancy in a camera,1
"this thing stinks! so much digital noise its output is terrible. i don't know how they can put this thing out and have it be so bad. don't be fooled thinking wow 8 megs for a low price, i have a 5 meg sony that is many times better. all that noise blows the detail out. get it if you like lots of little green and red flecks in your pictures, other wise stay away",1
"i ordered this tripod, and it arrived broken.the assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic.    i asked for an rma order via e-mail, and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice.'being lazy about mailing things back, and since it was cheap to begin with i tried repair it myself.  where it broke (the three plastic rings on the camera mount), it was impossible to re-glue, because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure.  even if your tripod arrives un-broken, it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all.",0
"the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  i brought them home and there is fog inside.  also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  i called bushnell's help line and they told me...""well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally""  when asked about the stuff on the inside.  ""that is probably fungus, that sometimes happens""  i just bought the binoculars!!!  he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.avoid these at all costs!!!  they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck",0
"i read other review, and decided to give it a try. as soon as i recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, i realized this was a mistake. cheap quality binocular with ""high power"" being a selling point. it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. you will be constantly ajdusting the focus. your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. indeed strap, case, lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all on~! i am taking this back, and buying made in japan ""nikon eagle view"" 100 times better. you get what you pay for~!!!!!",0
"i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. i had looked at swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.these binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. the 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's i've been using. i wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because i always used to lose them.for the price, these can't be beat",1

"this kit conveniently contains 20 sheets of photo paper. unfortunately, kodak doesn't contain an ink cartridge for them.fine, i thought, i'll buy a separate cartridge. guess what? you can't! kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper. why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges? seems pretty dirty",0

"i purchased, through work, the powershot s70 in july of 2005.  i've always owned nikon products personally, but the features for the price of the s70 swayed me away from my usual nikon brand loyalty.  in the 12 months i've had the s70, it's been sent to the factory twice for repairs--the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired.  the first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track.  eight months later, the flash quit working in all modes and the door was failing again!the flash and door problem occurred while i was in yosemite np, so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning.  now, the warranty is expired and i hold my breath every time i slide the lens door open.  i have no faith in the canon s70 and have lost a lot faith in canon products as a whole.the only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within 2-3 weeks, which i thought was fast for warranty work",0

"i made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. the color and noise was terrible. if you want a great point and shoot camera get the canon powershot s50 while they are still available. the camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. if you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery cathreen styles. all most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. i am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. by the way, i did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. i got the canon 30d and love it",1
"i just got this printer dock with a camera, and the printer feature is a real pain!  the paper will almost never feed no matter what i've tried.  when it does feed, it ends up jamming.  i only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone.  i'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back",0
i recently purchased the g600 printer dock and haven't even gotten to try it out yet--the print cartridge that came with it didn't work.  i ordered another and inserted it and it still doesn't work. it constantly tells me the cartridge is empty and needs replaced.  lots of time and money involved in this mess---stick with hp!,0
"here's the good news: i have had many cameras in my life, digital and film , and i have found the z1 to be my favorite.  the camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color.  my previous camera was a minolta dimage 7($800) and i found that this camera's photo quality was just as good.  the best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily.  owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life.here's the bad news:recently my camera broke and when i tried to contact fuji to get a replacement or a repair, the service was terrible.  their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support.  summary:great camera as long as it doesn't break.  it's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get fuji to repair it",1
"i bought the camera in may of 2006, as a graduation gift for my son.  he loved the style and compactness.he experienced focus/zoom problems after 1 use.  unfortunately he didn't start to use the gift for 2 months or i might have been able to return to amazon for a refund.  contacting fufifilm has been overly cumbersome. their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive (long waits).  they have had the toy camera (as this is being written)for over a week and when i called yesterday for status, they told me that the camera ""hasn't been diagnosed yet"".  i expect it will be, once their 90 day warranty expires, which will limit fujifilm's liability to the 1 repair.  i have a mean case of buyer's remorse.  i might as well have taken the ~$235.00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street.if you own one and it doesn't require repairs, you might like it.  if it ever requires repairs, you might feel as i that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera.  save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty, a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty.  you may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired.  i bought it in may of 2006....i feel like i lost it in july of 2006.if i could have given the z1 less then 1 star, i would have.  that's what it deserves!   !&%$$##444en fujifil",1
bought this camera for my wife.  takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution.  if you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill.  fuji customer relations is sub-par.  warranty does not cover any impact internal damage.  i've had better luck with nikon and kodak and will steer clear of fuji in the future,1
"i have two 8"" picture frames that are other brands, and they are great and i use them for open houses all the time! i got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!! the instructions are difficult to understand. the wide screen makes everyone in the picture look fat and distorted! this is a weird size and i am not happy at all!! i don't recommend it",0
"the battery which ""popped up"" with my camera order does not match the camera.  thus i am stuck with the hassel of returning a battery.  i was leaving for a trip when it arrived and so i had to go out and buy a replacement after it arrived.",0
product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  as of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  how would you rate my review,0
my frame freezes after displaying a few pictures. the remote doesn't work. there is no website for contact or support,1
"this is absolutely the worse digital device i have ever owned.  the manual is worthless and the web site even worse.  i try to delete the included photos, and nothing happens.  i can't download photos from my mac.  if your digital memory card has many photos, good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame.",0
"if you want to load directly from your camera's memory card the system takes forever to copy photos to the internal card.  there is no ""copy all"" function.loading information from a computer didn't work.  the usb connection was not recognized by windows xp and i couldn't find any drivers on the web.a setup cd would be a nice addition.btw the screen was not as large as one might think.  it is very wide but not tall and it crops the top & bottom of most pictures making it great for shots of the grand canyon but not for portraits of people",1
"i wish there was a space for zero stars.  we bought this frame for my in-laws for christmas and it worked for ten minutes and then died.  it was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing.  once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently.  do some research and buy another unit; that's what i'm going to do",0
"i received pandigital 7"" photo frame (dpf70-2) as a christmas gift and haven't been able to get the sd card slot to function. when connecting to the pc via usb cable it tells me the removable device needs to be formatted.  windows attempts to format the card and fails.  i'm able to format the card with a usb card reader and copy pictures to the sd card ok.  when i insert the sd card into the photo frame is doesn't display any of the pictures, just a blue frame around the picture location.i contacted pandigital tech support via 800# and never received a call back so i sent them an email.  i received email response back after several days.  they had me try several things to resolve the issue; this troubleshooting process went on for more than week to no avail. they eventually acknowledged the photo frame appeared defective, when i asked to exchange the photo frame (taking advantage of the 90 day warranty advertised on their site), they told me to return it to the store it was purchased.i do not consider this very good customer service; i would not recommend this product.",1
"having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch, i was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas, to see what a commercial frame would be like. after using it for a few weeks, i have to say that if it wasn't a present i would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation.the good: * screen is bright, images look great* resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me. doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen. * computer connection worked great - i plugged it into my xp box, all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up. it would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue.the bad: my main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before. if i bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50, i could have forgiven it for the poor design, but in 2007, for $180, it is completely unacceptable.  we live in the future here people, get with the program!  i have not used other frames on the market, but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12"" screen on ebay for $70, strap it into a cheap frame and make your own, pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame, just by running a screen saver for under $150, i'd say this frame is not worth the money at all. this screen just doesn't deliver the goods for the price.some details:* menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance, you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the ""setup"" button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global* remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny ir hole in the front of the screen.* screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame (i.e. as a 480x640 frame) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this ""feature"" off.* the slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images. your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that doesn't change.* no way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system.* good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens",1
"keep in mind that you can't use this product unless you buy an external flash. the built-in flash results in harsh shadows on the left edge of the photos. canon's responsethank you for your inquiry regarding the powershot g6.we are sorry to hear of any issues with the conversion lens.when using the built-in flash, a portion of the image may be blocked by the converters and appear dark. please refer to page 186 of the camera manual for detailed information. when the converters are used, it is recommended to not use the built-in flash.thank you for choosing canon",0
"i bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda.  it was ok.  felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to.  big drawback....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense.  my son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it.  some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality.  i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and i'm surprised, because i usually love samsung products",1

"i bought this to play back old hi8 tapes so i could transfer them to dvd. however, there is no s-video out and no stereo out. video quality was bad: output was noisey and reds were over saturated. i imagine this is because there is no s-video out. i returned it and have ordered a sony gv-d200. hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much. there are some cheaper used options available, e.g. sony evo-250",0
ok this is the third sony handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options..sony messed up with the usb port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the trv 280i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the trv 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality..its fuzzy.. im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the trv280 back..i hope this has helpe,0
"not worth the money spent on it.  after reviewing info on my new digital camera i followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on aa batteries.  i did not need the camera case that came with this kit, and it really had too many pockets for my liking.  the batteries did not hold a charge.  i only got a few pictures taken before they went dead.  if the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead.  at least i got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones.  i would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots.  i have had no experience with rechargables before so i do not know if this is common.  but i returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge",0
"we ownded this for around 10 months but used it for just 5-7 hours.it stopped working all of the sudden (no power)sent it for warranty, (part no labor). $160 labor fee just to know what was wrong with it.would not but another camcorder from panasonic (they even wanted me to pay for having it sent back)",0
"i have tried everything. firewire, usb. there was an insert in the guide that mentioned that you have to connect the cable first to your pc then to your camera, then turn on the pc then turn on the camera...then wait for the stars to align in the right order. if you do anything in a different order then your camera can get damaged. what kind of a crazy world does panasonic live in?well, i followed the instructions to the tee, downloded the right drivers and all and yet my pc does not recognize the gs19 or the gs9. i have used both. the gs19 is a new purchase so this is definitely going back. i thought, this model would have gone away with the kinks but, no!so, my panasonic recorded dvs are gonna remain on the tape. i will never be able to put them on dvds. what a joke, this camera turned out to be",1
"one of the most disastrous purchases we've ever made.  it works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer.  don't bother trying to consult the instruction guide; it's the worst one you've ever seen.  you could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need, but they're not actually on the website.definitely find another brand",0
"this camera was easy to use and it was light and had decent quality picture and audio, however, i was unable to make copies for back-up or to share with family members. i took it back and bought a mini-dv camcorder as i was told it was easier to make copies. this has yet to be tested",1
"this camcorder worked well, but i had two complaints with it.1.  on the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth, sounds like a woodpecker.  this alone made it unacceptable or what i wanted to do.2.  i wanted high quality video, but since it records on a small dvd disk, the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk.  this causes some loss of detail in the picture, especially if you're going to edit it and rerecord the video which i need to do.if you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player (and not all dvd players will play the small dvds) this camera might be acceptable.  i returned it and bought a panasonic pv-gs35minidv camcorder which uses the minidv cassette tape.  much better video quality because its not compressd, and no noise from the tape drive",1
"be warned, if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive, you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing, sharing, whatever.  can't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step.  i was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks, but couldn't find one.  i searched all over, asked in several places on the apple web boards, talked to the 'geniuses' at the apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive.  talk about crazy!",0
"don't order this battery unless you have money to throw away!  i ordered one that would not hold a charge, called the company and they told me it was defective and to send it back.  did that and got a replacement that proved to be just as bad.  now after 3 months, it isn't even holding a charge for more that 15 minutes of usage time!!!  this is unacceptable, and again the company is still trying to stand behind their bogus product!  avoid at all cost, even if that means paying the extra $10 bucks for an original kodak branded battery",0
"i used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it.  it took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more, then nothing for the rest of the roll.  we swam with sharks and i have nothing to show for it. should have bought a disposable one",1
i purchased this camera for a friend to use in hawaii.  we had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and i was frustrated.  i do not know if this is just a bad camera or what,0
"this is the worst camera i've ever owned. i'm not exaggerating. i'm so upset for wasting money on it. the only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. it takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. the video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. my friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. it just plain sucks.",0
"as i have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult, as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus.  i thought this might be a solution.this eyecup fails on all requards.  worst feature, the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect.  second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless.   last it has the cheep feel of cracker jack plastic, well and the optics to match.  now i know where olympus had it manufactured",1
offers no eye comfort whatsoever. magnification is very weak. stick to original eye cu,1
"the me-1 provides a modest 1.2x magnification for viewfinders on olympus's e-300 and e-500 cameras. ideally, this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing. unfortunately, this did not happen when i used the me-1 to make a number of trial images with my e-500, so i will be returning the me-1 for a refund. (for the record, i wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting, with my ""shooting eye"" corrected to 20/20 vision.) like other folks, i find the e-500 viewfinder a trifle small so that it's not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time. the camera must also be pressed against your face when framing, which is not always comfortable. in some ways, the me-1 created more problems than it solved. the me-1 kept the camera further from my face (though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses), but at the cost of *narrowing* my angle of vision in the viewfinder. divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares. the four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible, but those along the sides, top, and bottom were *less* visible than before, the corners considerably less. to frame a shot, i had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the me-1 than without it. to see exposure data, i had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image. more hassle than i need when shooting in the field.fortunately, there is another option that works for me. the e-300 and e-500 come with an ep-5 eyecup, which is definitely too small for my taste. but a larger eyecup is also available, the ep-6. the ep-6 keeps the camera a little further from my face. and with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted (a critical step no one seems to mention), the ep-6 allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all. all of this will vary from person to person, of course, and there may be circumstances when the me-1 is exactly what's needed -- so two rather than one star. but not in standard shooting conditions, especially if you need to compose, set exposure, and shoot quickly",1
almost useless! tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration. went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier.professional medical photographer,0
this bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets.  quite small for the price.   just paying for the name on the bag,1
not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on. i would turn it off and on and nothing would help. finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in. this seemed to fix the problem a few times. after that i thought it was just operator error. but it wasn't. the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile. an event came up about a month later. i got my camera and tried to turn it on. nothing happened. so i changed the batteries. still nothing happened. i'm not sure what happened. i do believe i purchased a lemon camera. i'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung. it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. so i guess you get what you pay for!,0
"so this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. i go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. it would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. alarmed, i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again.but that was only one thing wrong with it. this is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. it woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. you can't trust this camera. you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute!",0
"i guess i really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of crap",1
"i purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. i would not recommend this camera.",0
"if you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok.. but why buy this monster for that? i have a t1 that does the trick there and gives 5mp. ok, so maybe video? ok, but then why do i want a dvd with nothing but raw footage? cant edit it without a lot of work. (where is the firewire port, or even the ability to edit an mpg file?) geeez.. anyway.. i am taking mine back. it is totally useless to me as i already have a still shot camera.. save your money.. dont do it..",1
"this is a nice case, however, i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends. this case is bulky and my panasonic fxo1 would fit into something much smaller. i ended up going with a great case that i found at wal-mart for a cheeper price, sleeker design, small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town",1
"this case looks good and protects the camera adequately, but is too bulky. it hasn't got a lot of room inside - i was unable to fit an extra sd card in its little case and a spare battery. the belt clip is difficult to use, and i end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time. there are better cases for this camera",1
this case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card. it only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap. there are other cases available with better features for less money,1
"i found a case that's almost exactly like this one, except it's $10 cheaper.it's made by samsonite.  model # tm90blu (there is also a black case).  but like i said, exact same thing.  unless you care about your camera case saying ""lumix"", save yourself some dough and get the one from wal-mart",1
"this is the first digital camera that i have owned.  overall i am generally satisfied with the quality of the pictures it produces.  however, there are a few things that, if i had known beforehand, would have prevented me from purchasing this camera.1) camera is not plug-and-play (even if they say it is).  you have to install the kodak easyshare software to download pictures.  this is a huge negative.  in the future, i will only buy cameras that show up as removable storage drives when plugged into a computer.2) video is stored in apple quicktime format (*.mov).  the is also a huge negative.  the codecs for this format are not widely available for application integration.  you have to download and use apple quicktime to view them.  you can not view the videos in windows media player.  it is also not compatible with some photo-album software.  i would only buy cameras in the future that have an option to store video in a non-proprietary format.update:  after review, i have found that winxp and vista plug-n-play with the camera when it is plugged into the usb port.  it does not work on win2k.  thanks for the comment that made me double-check",1
"i like this camera.  some settings take it beyond the standard point and shoot experience. for a first-timer, it has been great. the camera rates 4 stars.customer service, on the other hand, has been a disaster. an easy share software downloaded update didn't load properly and led me on a trail of three customer service reps over the course of 4 1/2 hours with no resolution. after requesting to speak to a customer service manager, i was promised that a $7.95 cd of the software would be sent for free (though it was clear he was doing me a favor because ""these cd's cost money and don't grow on trees,"" he said. whether or not the cd solves the problem remains to be seen. but customer service is awful.to recap: nice camera, but unless you have endless customer service patience, search out other options",1
"i keep this frame on all day and night. the lcd backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out.the quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res. is not good if viewing up close.there is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag. regular lcd backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night. this one just lasted 4 months. so the image is almost non-existant now. in the glare, you can barely make out the image so it's still there but with no backlight so good as dead.i would recommend a more expensive philips ones. my friend has had it for about two years and it's still going. plus it's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips, which this one can't",0
i bought this frame in jan. '07 and the screen burned out march '07.  i returned it and the newest one burned out last night - april '07.  this product needs a redesign - the screens don't work for long.,1
purchased this item in dec 06' screen burned out mar 07'. on top of that screen quality was not that great. do not order order this item,0
"i bought this product from a nearby retailer. the packaging is deceptive. the photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer. the battery is $35.00 with shipping, and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring. this frame has no on-board memory, so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts. this is an additional expense. after purchasing the photoframe i discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should. i took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before i found one which had an unbroken frame. i took that photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described. i then went to another of the retailers' locations to exchange the device (the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer). with the retailer's very helpful clerks i tested three more photoco photoframe devices, none of them worked as described (they would not scroll through and album of photos). i returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device, then by email i requested a refund for the price of the battery. photoco replied that if i sent them the battery they would refund its price. i mailed the battery on may 6,and then inquired about my refund on may 14. photoco replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick. on 3/17 i sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund. photoco said that my credit had been processed but that i might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days. i still have not received my credit for the battery. if you want to avoid a headach, avoid doing business with this company. read the other reviews before considering this product",1
"nowhere on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card (ms or sd).  it will not operate without it!  on the back of the package it reads ""download photos with usb cable (incl.) or simply insert memory card (ms or sd - not incl.)""  wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device - they cannot",0
"the photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering.  the ""plug and play"" ability is aggravating, at best, freezing two of my computers, requiring endless reboots to transfer images.  photoshare provides zero customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual. the expensive battery is almost impossible to install.  the power cord has to be super glued to stay in place. and the frame is sloppy and dangerous - very easy for unit to fall out.  buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable dvd player instead.",1
"quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 i purchased as gifts. in fact, the recipients asked me to return them. main reason, in order for it to be ""portable"" it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $30. i already spent $100, not planning on spending more money. i think photoco needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction.",1
"i added these batteries to an order of a few other things, and didn't realize that they were going to ship this separately from circuit city. make sure if you pick this, that you are getting something else from cc, or else you will end up like me. with a huge box (you could fit 4 tom clancey novels in the box) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries",1
you have listed this battery as an accessory to the camera and now that i have purchased it i discover that this battery doesn't fit this camera. it is listed wrong,0
beware of poor cs policy at jvc. they recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built. they were not interested in even trying to help.i hate it when companies only care about their profits,0
this unit would be beautiful except for the fact that the input power plug and the on/off switch has a serious design flaw.  i received the unit and it worked one time upon the first plug in of power.  after that it became intermittent for about two or three switches off and on.  it then failed completely and would not work at at all.i returned it and ordered another identical unit and it worked only one cycle on and would not come on at all after that. on both units the mp3 player continued to work.  there is definately a serious problem with the power input receptical and/or the on/off switch.  but for this problem it would be a wonderful unit,1
tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d-524 camera. turned out to be a downgrade. did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts. it would die a sudden death -- no low battery warnings before the camera shut down. i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts. the cr-v3 now gathers dust. it did not even improve the flash recycle time. just a waste,0
"the battery is good after a full charge.  it lacks in holding the promised charge.  i find after 2 weeks it is questionable, depending on how many pictures were taken before the camera sat waiting to be used again. i got over 100 pictures when used in 3 days, which is more that my aa nimh 2100mah. which i bought from walmart {so probably not a super battery}  the wallmart batteries actually hold the charge longer {very sad}.the charge time is not to long when charger from half charge.over all, i hope the next ones i buy will be better than these.  my solution is to carry a non rechargeable battery in my case for when the delkin dies.  i also try to give it a full charge before leaving the house, as there is no memory effect.  i also recomend checking to see if there is a firmware upgrade for your camera.  every camera shuts off when the battery is at a different power level.  my nikon coolpix 3100, seems to shut down sooner than later.  all reviews should mention what camera they are using for this reason.  have been using 3 months now.",1
"i've had this battery for half a year and i agree with a fellow reviewer's assessment that the battery does not hold much power. i am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory, but this delkin model's life span was noticeably short. now i am going to buy a new charger/battery altogether because i don't want to buy another delkin battery",1
i bought this battery in july 2004. i charged it as soon as i got it. i put it in the camera and then used the camera about 10 days later. the battery was dead. so i charged it again and put it in the camera again. i used it and it seemed to work fine. but the next time i went to use the camera (approximately 2 weeks to a month later.) it was dead again. as i write this review i am sitting in a hotel room in prague. i charged the battery ten days ago. i used it once 7 days ago and took approximately 15 to 20 pictures(did not use the flash). i then used it again today. i was able to get another 15 to 20 pictures before it went dead( did not use the flash). i bought the lithium rechargeable battery because they have the longest life and no memory. so now i have to charge the battery everytime i use the camera. this was a big disappointment. i get better life out of the standard duracell alkalines. it appears that this technology hasn't been perfected or that belkin has not perfected their quality control. beware when buying this product,0
"i purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework, and reading all the reviews i could on the different kinds. the one i purchased was flawed, and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before i could get it to boot up. when it was running i was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures.  what the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable- so it does not hook up to a computer. this means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera, or that you must have/purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card.( a side note - if you have a sony digital camera, memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent, you took with another camera, or you reformatted with a photo program).   i went with the digital pic frame from brookstone instead - far better quality, and much more user friendly",1
"in my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.  my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended.  i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate",1
"i gave this picture frame to my wife for a christmas gift,we pluged it in and within a half an hour it made a loud bang and smoke poured out of the thing like crazy....not a good gift.",1
"i am [...] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card. 16 mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough! read on!if you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory. this is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible. (because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card.) looking further on p13 it states: ""choosing slideshow frequency note: this function applies to photos stored on all media."" page 27 in faq states: ""2) q: can i switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards? a: yes. when you connect your memory card to photoframe(tm), it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card."" finally, the quick start guide faq states: ""q can i switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards? a yes, digital photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected."" clearly the three references i provide indicate that the dpf can operate slideshows from a media card. in reality slideshows from media cards does not work. philips how about a firmware upgrade?i bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures. i was planning on sending preloaded cards to her. all she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on. (mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets..). do not buy this dpf for older, none computer savvy people. since media card can not be used, you have to use the internal memory for slideshows. the internal 16mb memory can hold about 70 pictures - that's it. it is also unclear the maximum size a file can be. i believe the internal memory converts the file to a dpf friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card. (how is mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed?)why have media card slots if they are useless? internal memory is way too small! do not buy and save yourself the hassle.",1
"i ordered this digital frame for my husband for christmas, with the assurance from a ""tech weenie"" that it would work, based on the advertisement found at amazon. still uncertain whether the ad (also found in philips cursory literature) is really true. my husband is working with the ""phone people"" at philips to determine whether it will or will not interface with mac. if it does eventually work, the process has not been easy",1
"i bought this camera for its great price, good reviews, and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter. i returned the camera after three weeks, however, due to abysmal low light performance among other things.the catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child. i took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor/delivery and follow up. unfortunately, when we returned home to view our footage, much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes.the camera does include a light and a magicpix option, but unless you're using a tripod, you're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect (perfect for recreating ""thriller music videos,"" but not much help otherwise.)i also found the image quality with the gs31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated. granted, you get what you pay for, but i was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage.that being said, the camera did a lot better in good/outdoor lighting (albeit still somewhat pixilated), and the zoom is incredible. the camera is very light and smaller than i anticipated.in the end, i returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment (...)i will say that amazon did a great job with customer service throughout. also, if you do buy this camera, make sure to buy the dv cable (firewire for macs) through amazon or some other online retailer.

"we returned this video camera due to video picture quality. the camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video, even after changing settings, the video had a ""grainy"" look. we just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work, but the picture was worse than our previous camera. purchased the pv-gs65, next model up with 3ccd's and love this model. as a matter a fact we still had the gs-31, used the same tape, shot the same footage, and reviewing the two different shots, the gs-65 did 100% better. the camera has a great feel in your hand, although the menu button can be difficult to press",1
panasonic offers a usb driver however no video driver. this means that anyone using windows xp will be unable to transfer video to their computer. when talking to panasonic they just said they didnt have a driver and were not developing one. they offered no suggestions or alternatives,0
"i've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but i am not having the same experience. the quality of the photos are horrible so i started thinking it was me and i tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, i only get one good shot out of about ten. i have a fuji 4mp that i bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. i bought this so i could give my old one to my daughter but i'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my fuji. we recently had snow here in tucson so i took pictures with mu fuji and compares them to the canon and the 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down. i don't get it, did i get a defective camera or am i doing something wrong or does this camera just suck",0
the camera came with no memory  chip.  the online store had no more of this camera or chips so the only thing they could suggest was to return it for a refund.  not a great experience,0
"i was extremely disappointed with this camera.  it's a shame there is no option for zero stars, because it doesn't even deserve one.  i bought two of them for a vacation to belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water, and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera.  now i really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can. all of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible, terrible quality.  the camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water.  those pictures were so grainy that we couldn't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of.  extremely disappointing for a camera that wasn't even submerged in water.  not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none, so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they weren't even on the negatives.i was so disappointed in this camera that i wrote to kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras.  unfortunately our trip to belize was a once in a lifetime trip, so i have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done.  and i have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again. if you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories, do not waste your money on this one.  the only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment.  i wish i had done more research before purchasing this one - please don't even bother with it",0
"my husband and i bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting. due to weather, the snorkeling was canceled, but we did end up using the cameras.  one we used for regular pictures, outdoor only, beacuse there's no flash, and it was okay, though the pictures were a bit grainy. the other i took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll, i could turn and turn the winder, and the film wouldn't advance, but it would let me take another picture. after fighting with it the entire weekend, i ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out, though these were grainy, too",0
"i bought this camera and it took great pictures above water, but none of the pictures i took underwater turned out. i looked at the negatives and it was like i never even clicked the shutter. the negatives were blank where i took the underwater pictures",1
"i purchased this camera and took it to the beach.  the photos were so bad, i threw them away.  the images were all washed-out and blurry.  also, the film advancing mechanism is very tricky, so several of the pictures i took overlapped each other.  i've used other disposable cameras before that wouldn't let you take a picture until the film had been fully advanced to the next frame.  with this camera, i advanced the film until the mechanism stopped, and the camera allowed me to take another picture.  unfortunately, the film hadn't advanced fully and the next picture partially overlapped the previous picture that i had taken.  what a waste of money this camera was!thankfully, i had also taken my digital camera, so i still had some good pictures of my trip :)",0
"made the mistake of taking this camera on a trip to the pool!!pictures were horrible. eye piece is the biggest pain!! don't buy this piece of junk. if you want great, good, wonderful pictures, buy the fuji quicksnap camera. kodak could have done much, much better",1
"i bought this camera after using a sony minidv (very small one) camera over 8 years. the image quality of sanyo is horrible compared to my old sony under any condition: daylight, night etc. however price, size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time. so if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it, but this is not a serious replacement to a high-end camcorder.",1
"i read the reviews and thought i'd still give it a try.after one battery charge, i was ""lucky"" enough to have a defective unit - the camera wouldn't start again after the first charge.my observations from that first short use were:- quality of pictures was very poor (my pentax optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos) -- very disapointing for a 6mp camera.- the flash was generally useless, and actually hurt quality- the camera was very uncomforable if you don't have very small hands.  my wrist hurt after using it for 20 minutes.- the video was ok, but the focus was very slow (and noisy).- i had the same problem as several others -- that the camera died shortly afer getting it (shows very poor quality).all-in-all don't waste your money.  you can get a much better camera at a lower price",0
"this camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to pc via usb. however, the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus, which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion. the clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation.we returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect, but the second unit had the same problem. apparently, according to the manual, this is ""not a malfunction""",0
"in theory, this camera is perfect. fits into your pocket. video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of mpeg-4. pictures are good if you know how to finesse it. perfect all around anytime camrea, right?here's the thing. i got the camera mainly for video. i just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that i could always have on me. also, i did not want minidv because uploading to the computer is real time. i wanted the sd card as film, even if it would sacrfice some video quality. but the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor/ auotfocus nosie. on the playback i cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses. it sounds like someone smoking a hooka. and get this, it even says so in the instruction manual, page 35, ""caution during video clip playback, the sound of a motor is audible....during recording, the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded. this is not a malfunction.""awful.by the way, the take a picture while recording video function is worthless. it leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording, and the still image captured is usually blury. whats the point anyway, i think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video. or you can do it with whatever editing software you use.oh, and one last thing. i have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic. my hand shakes too much. there is a digital stabalization for the video, but no optical stabilization for the stills.its a big shame, too. the camera is very cool. if not for the audible motor noise, i would have given this at least an 8/10. but the lens motor noise is unacceptable!ps. all cameras today should have a built in lens cover. this is one has a cheap plastic one, that you'll probably lose",1
"i really wanted to love this camera. the camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans! i did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so i expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews. the 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video... but the unit fits into my pocket! another huge plus is that each ""shot"" is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a pc using a usb cable. no further processing - the file just copies and plays in quicktime, etc. another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie, which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do.now the sad part; amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the lcd and ccd. the bad pixels on the lcd, according to the manual, are expected and ""not a malfunction""; i disagree with that. for the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the lcd monitor. the huge problem is the bad pixels on the ccd! this results with white pixels being recorded on the files; this is compounded by the ""image stabilization"". the image stabilization shifts the image the ccd receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great! however, as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well. it's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record.the bad ccd is the reason why i can't love the c6... i gave up hope and sent both back to amazon. i'm not sure what i will buy now.",1

"so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like ""um... is that it???"" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards... also, there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it, also, the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all... other than that, it's cute, but not the best out there.",0
"i bought this camera in the beginning of january. i was looking for a compact camera (not necessarily pocket size, though) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality. based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd. i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive, which is true. after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions, with and without flash, bright light, low light, different iso settings, different exposure times, etc. i compared the pictures with my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 and the results were amazing. the picture quality of the fuji was very poor. colors were 'smeared' but the main problem was noise. even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise, same with other colors (rgb noise). i didn't check grey/black noise (as they do in the test reports) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying. what a disappointment. the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well, at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc-v1 with a carl zeiss lens. after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5. this is really a great camera, i must admit. the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good. i can only recommend sony's h5, even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd. what i liked about the f31fd was its size, its responsiveness and the monitor and menu. however, if the picture quality is so poor it also doesn't really help",1
"i bought these binoculars because i wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding.  first time out, i had difficulty getting a clear focus.  to make maters worse, every bird that i looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it's head.  i have a pair of nikon 10x25s which out performed the bushnell's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness. i am returning the bushnell's and considering the audubon equinox hp binoculars instead.",0

"in my opinion this is not a marketable product. the cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work. there is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix. when it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit. as for hd - possibly at high noon in the sahara, but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing.",1
"the quality is not real hd looking.  the footage is jumpy.  the camera is terrible in low light.  even indoors during the day, you have to blast light into the camera to get a readable image.  i returned mine and i'm looking to getting the much better sony hd cam which is almost double the price, but at least they were smart enough to put a video light on it.  being a professional filmmaker and knowing what cameras shoot real hd, i quickly realized that i got ripped off.  this may be good only if you're shooting mostly outdoors during the day, but don't expect to bring it to a party, club, or out on the town at night.  it seems like they should have devoted effort to making the low light shooting excellent.  the size of the camera is amazing and the fact that there are no tapes is great.  i was really disappointed because i was expecting something better.  most digital cameras shoot better video, seriously",1
"before that it was kind of nice, but it cannot focus in even semi-low light.it is definitely light and easy to take everywhere, but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing. no way i would call the output hd quality, just the best sd ever with a 16 * 9  format. and then it broke",1
"i purchased the camera in mid june 2006. after 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. it took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. i used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. the recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. this camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. the store were i bought it said that it would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. the only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do i get by getting a new camera? just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem",0
"this camera has major problems.  do your research.  go to any digital camera forums and you will see tons of post of  the ""black screen"".    after using our camera about 5 times the screen became black.  apparently had to do with defective lens housing or something.  sent it to their customer care service.  took 1 month to get back.  3 days later black screen is back.  sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera.  they just want me to keep sending to customer. care.     sanyo has a very defective product and they do not want to admit their mistake and replace the defective cameras.  see for yourself.   go to the forums and see what others have been saying.  don't make the mistake i did",0
"the noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  do not buy it!  if you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... never.  no matter how hard you try.my 3-year old 5mpx sony is much better than this panasonic camera.  i am sorry i bought it. i would return this product if i could and buy a good camera instead.the lumix dmc-lx2 camera cannot focus one bit, many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem.  even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred.  noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily.  you can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness, noise reduction, contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem.the amazon website says you can use standard sd memory which is untrue(perhaps this has been corrected now).  the camera only accepts more expensive sdhc (high capacity) cards.  these sdhc cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so i have to use the usb port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer.",0
i have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. i bought this camera to replace another nikon coolpix that was stolen from my house. but this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. i have always liked nikon cameras but the s9 just doesn't make it. i can not use it outside because i can not see the lcd screen. sorry nikon but you blew it on this camera!!so i replaced it with a canon powershot a710. what a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1g memory card from rhe nikon fots in the new canon.,1
"i purchased a nikon for my first camera, i just loved how you can take it anywhere, fits handy in your pocket and perfect size. i couldn't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo's. for my birthday i took over 100 photo's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost. i was so devistated. the video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people's faces. my friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo's. so maybe i just got the short end of the stick...but this was my first camera so its okay for starters...but if you love to take photo's be full aware that on a low battery that it just might not want to hold them. a major plus i do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image! that i'll give 5 stars to...everything else i'd have to say 2 stars!",1

"i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years. i was extremely happy with my olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting. this camera was such a disappointment. just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it. (this only happened when using the flash. i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. the first digital camera i ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! the store i bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy. so, i sold the camera and took a $100 loss. i'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera",1
"there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website.  ""if there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  however, this is not a malfunction.""  read:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  sony does not think this is a problem.  it is a design flaw.if you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!",1

"this is an awesome little camera.  except that you can't use it at night!  there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  it's a known problem [...]also, it's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology.  as a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of usb??!!), and you have to buy a sony memory stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  on the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.but other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  the lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as i could tell, quality was good.in the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??",1
"this is the 7th olympus camera i've owned over the years, from film to digital.  i have always been very pleased with olympus cameras and their usual superior optics.  this camera, though, is a major disappointment, mainly because even though it can shoot in raw, there is no compatible conversion available yet, leaving you unable to process raw images.  this renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in jpeg.  olympus should have ensured that vendors such as adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible raw conversion plug-ins available before this camera hit the market.  there's no excuse for olympus to not have made sure this was the case, indeed it's downright irresponsible.having said the above, the camera lens is quite nice, the camera itself operates well.  you can take quite good pictures.  however, the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken----if you're taking pictures of people, they will have moved by the time the picture is taken.the battery life is very good.  the camera fits nicely in your palm. and, having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great.  if you don't shoot in raw and you don't depend on flash photography, the camera is worth a look.  otherwise, look at other products at this time",1
"i was so excited to buy a camcorder that recorded straight to dvd and took pictures.......well, the picture quality is awful! i have gotten maybe 20 nice pics out of over a 1000........the problem is its so low in pixels. we hear about 5mp cameras and up, this camera has less than 1mp!!!! i bought this before i knew anything about megapixels........you have to have 5 or more for the prints to be decent. all of my prints from this camera are bad! and they are only good for email. that's it. the camcorder capabilities are fair. my problem is that it doesn't work well on the computer, and it does not play immediately in all dvd players. you have to buy the very expensive ram discs for editing....overall, i definitely would not buy again and i would not reccommend to a friend. i wish i had spent all that money on something else....",0
"this camcorder is only good for outdoor recording. in indoor recording or recording in little bit low light, picture quality is very bad. i tried to record in my living room where i have two 100 watt bulbs but recorded picture was very blurred. in outdoor recording in a sunny day, picture quality is quite good with sharp colors. zoom works well",1

"don't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers.  i'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 mp nikon coolpix sq as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop.  what've i've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 mp images from this hp camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  the images look absolutely horrible.  my little nikon sq with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one",0
"the case looks exactly as in the pictures above, and the camera fits perfectly in it. however, the case is hardly a protection, it's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag. the velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so i've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors. fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around, so my camera stays with me in any event.there is a little strap on the case, supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps, but it opens too easily, so it can't be trusted at all (the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case, which is not much).there is also a small pocket in the back, providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries (4 aa batteries) and the usb cable. again, the velcro on it is too easy to open, even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket.definitely, this is not designed as a practical solution. just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches.if you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun, while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents, don't buy this one. spend some more money and get a decent carrying case. i will",1
"the s9000 fits perfectly in the case. too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop. apparently, the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also. too bad the camera strap is extremely short, made for very small people. so, instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well, i will adapt the case to work for me. i will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera. i can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on. it will work but only after extensive modification. great camera design so it's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before",1
"in the past, i have considered amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites. to be perfectly honest, i am no longer sure. two months ago, i bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on amazon. this camera set was called the 1 gb stylus 720 sw kit. ironically, the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 gb cards! my first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories. two weeks after receiving the kit, i emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake. after waiting a few weeks for a response, i decided to send them a second email. again, no response. by this point, i felt helpless and turned to amazon for aid. surprisingly, amazon was not much better than 47th st photo. minutes after sending the email to amazon, i received an automatic email informing me that amazon had received my email. that was the last i heard from amazon. more than two months have passed and i have not heard from either company",1
i have purchased the pv-gs65 and everytime i use the camera with autofocus it makes everything blurry and only stays in focus for about 3 seconds.  i returned my camcorder and got another one (pvgs65) and i am still having this problem.  everytime i have used the camera i have to use manual focus.if anyone else has had this problem or knows how i could get this fixed please email me or post another review.           brandonwg8677@comcast.net                                  thank you,0
"so, you go out and plunk down nearly 600 bucks of your hard-earned cash for a panasonic pb-gs65 dv camcorder. it is a digital video camcorder, after all. that's why you bought it. well, guess what? it doesn't come with a dv cable to plug it into anything. that is so pathetically stupid i take it as an outright slap from a company that must think i'm just some sort pain in their shorts. it cost me completion of a project that i had to put together as soon as the camera arrived. so, panasonic, i'll post a negative review of as many of your products i possibly can over the next few weeks and make you pay as much as possible for being about as stupid a company as i've ever had to deal with. oh yeah, and you're camcorder is being returned. go buy a cable and have a ball",0
we purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera.  it took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today's reasonably priced minidv camcorders.  however after six months the lcd screen suddenly stopped working.  it was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great.  we sent it last november to the panasonic authorized service center.  they returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available.  we were out $100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old.  i only share this as a warning to potential buyers.  panasonic did not honor our warranty,0

"cons only, no pros:the velcro closure is week and opens easilyterrible lookthe side zippers are a mistery, totally uselessno space for extra memory or batteryattaches only to a very small beltthe flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash",0
"overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your panasonic lx1 or lx2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  first, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  there is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2"" wide.  also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  this might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use.",0
"the night owl optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as i started using it. the system uses high voltage derived from 2-aa bateries. occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. if one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. i have returned the monocular to night owl for repairs. i do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. they told me to ship it at my expense.another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours.other than the above, the monocular has performed well.epilogue-night owl optics did repair the unit and returned it.",1
"i bought this item over a year ago, and it has never served for anything. once i spotted a deer and turned on the ""ir"" illuminator, and the deer ran away - not too surprising, it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals. better use a flashlight. this is a first-generation nightscope, and has a very small range of utility: if there is a little light, the adapted human eye sees better, and if there is almost no light the device does not see either. 100 bucks is not too much of a waste, but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much",0
"the field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.  if you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark.  but if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.  also, there is too much ""noise"" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing.the ir makes the field of vision even smaller.  overall i did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.  by the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark.  you can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic",1
"it was suggested by amazon.com that i buy this product since i was purchasing a canon powershot s2is digital camera. not knowing any better, i bought it.  it doesn't even work with this model camera. i bought a memory card reader instead at a local store & bypassed the need for an adapter altogether",0
"it takes too long to focus and shoot! this, coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card, well, it is horrible.  people who write in saying they didn't notice the the slow focus and writing, must be either paid by nikon or total nubs.do not buy this camera. it did take decent movies, and the size is nice",0

"this is not the best way to get started in astronomy. the low power eyepiece is fairly useful, the higher power one less so, and don't even think of using the barlow.  the maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120-140x, assuming the objective lens is of good quality. when you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope, you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown.  to their credit, the manufacturer has provided a reflex ""red dot"" finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes.  even so, what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited.  some star clusters will be dimly visible, but galaxies and nebulae will be barely--if at all--visible. in a way, it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope.  their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. it is a learned skill. and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. if you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8"") dobsonian; celestron's own 6"" starhopper can be found on amazon for under $290.for more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on amazon: ""so you want to buy a telescope.",1
"this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  here's why:1.  the objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  i suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  the planets will appear as very small disks.  one will be able to see saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.  2.  the mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  the earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.  3.  the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  the observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  the barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.  4.  the mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to ""shiver"", which is very frustrating.  even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.  jim ""konedog"" koenig, astronomy buf",1

"i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures, so i expected better. i ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket, making collimation impossible. in celestron's defense, it likely happened in transit. amazon's return policy is not a hassle, and i'm upgrading her to another telescope. i'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope. only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily",1
"i had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course. after a lot of research, i settled on the pro tour laser. as previous reviewers have stated, this unit is very hard to stabilize.  i have a feeling this is true of all lasers. even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car i found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present. on the golf course, finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping. this unit has been returned and i have gone to a standard handheld gps instead. once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint, this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage, you just have to convert feet or 1/100's of a mile into yards. i do this with a chart taped on the back of the gps. accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper. i am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles.",1

"after reading the great reviews regarding the vct870rm tripod (here and elsewhere), i decided to purchase one for my sony hdr-hc1 camcorder. when i first opened the box, the vct870rm seemed sturdy and well made.  the tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch, and the remote controls on the handle worked well.  however, the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan, the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly.  it felt like the tension control knob was tightened, but that was not the case.  in fact, the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.i recently found a vct870rm review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning.  however, due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod, i'm assuming that i just received a bad one.i'm now in the process of working with amazon to get a replacement sent to me.  so far, amazon has been great, as they've already scheduled ups to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day.  they say that i'll receive my new tripod next week.  i'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.update:  i received a new replacement vct870rm tripod from amazon, and this one works great.  panning and tilting are both very smooth, and the tension is adjustable.  if i'd have received this tripod originally, i would've given it 5 stars.  the first vct870rm i received was definitely defective.  i'm glad i returned it, and i'm glad i bought it through amazon (best price at the time, and a hassle-free return)",1
"like other reviewers, after careful research, i decided to purchase this product. it was affordable, received good reviews, and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range. when i received it in mail, i was quite happy: it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what i had expected. the screen was bright and very attractive. the problems started about three weeks following the purchase. first, the slideshow option (the kind with music) stopped working. whenever i pushed the slideshow button, the screen would completely freeze and i had to restart the unit in order to use any other function. i thought, no big deal, i would just exchange the frame for another one.my second unit arrived yesterday. this one, however, started having problems right out of the box. after about 5 minutes into the slideshow, the screen started flickering, than shaking, became completely staticky and finally it re-started automatically. i played it two more times after that, each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow.it is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential (big, bright screen); unfortunately, the software is very buggy. i checked the portable usa website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix. i will have to return this unit again, this time for a refund.my assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box. however, i would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership",1

"if i could, i would give this camcorder a 0 of 5. since i now have to search for a new camcorder, from reading other panasonic model reviews, i am convinced i did not just get a lemon, but the panasonic brand is bad. we bought this camcorder 18 months ago at the birth of our son. it has had problems from the beginning. first, i could not finalize the disk. i called panasonic support, who basically told me the problems we were having were because the camera was not being held still while recording. this is ridiculous since i often set the camera down on a countertop so i can be in the video. then i finally got someone to tell me that i needed to be recording on panasonic mini-dvds. the best it has worked have been on the panasonic dvds which are some of the most expensive, and even that is no guarantee that you will be able to watch the dvd after finalization. i still have freezing of the picture and sparatic playback when trying to watch. it has skipped over whole sections. i have 3 dvd players in my home (all different brands) and the disk works on none of them.i finally got an address to send it in for repairs. i was not happy to be without my camcorder for an extended period of time. i was told they would look at the camcorder, see if there was a problem and call me. i waited a week after i knew it was in the shop to check the status. panasonic failed to mention that i would need to pay $207.50 up front for them to look at it, then if any repairs were needed, this cost would cover them as well. so, i have been without a camcorder for 3 weeks while waiting to see if it needed fixing, and the company i sent it to has not even looked at it because i have not paid them! this is crazy since i can get a brand new minidv camcorder for $225. the only reason it has taken me so long to take drastic action is because we are military living overseas and bought it at best buy. so you see why i couldn't just take it back to the store (or i would have a long time ago)! also after spending over $500 on this piece of junk, i could not afford to just replace it. sending it in was not an option when my son was a newborn, because i didn't want to miss any precious memories (which i ened up missing anyway!). so now the holidays are upon us, and i will be forced to purchase another camcorder, since i don't know if they will send it back to me in time for christmas. i will not pay the $207.50 for a camera that hasn't worked well out of the box. i also had to pay shipping both ways for nothing!plus another thing, the still picture is bad quality. very grainy and you can actually see pixels when you print it. we only used that function once. i have lost so many disks, and have so many others that only play part of the dvd that when i think of it i cry. i have also wasted so much time trying to figure out how to fix the problem with a customer support that is useless. i wish i would have never bought this camcorder! if you are buying this camcorder to capture memories, buy another! i will not buy panasonic products again!",0
"after reading the reviews a bought the accessory kit. i compared the eyepieces and the barlow with standard inexpensive plossls (orion, knigth owl, gso) and the celestron's optics looked the worst one. i sold the kit after 2 weeks..",0
"i recently bought a new celestron nexstar 4se telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit.  much to my disappointment, the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope, and when cold (nights in colorado are 25-45f), the eyepieces did not fit at all.  celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised.  when i called a second time, they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem.  amazon replaced the kit (thank you amazon!), but the replacements did not fit either.  i'm returning that kit too.  i finally bought a kit from meade (3 eyepieces and a moon filter) that fit properly and are very easy to use.  to be fair, if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value (hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1).  the meade kit is a worse value, but because they work in my nice new scope, they are the best for anyone using a nexstar 4se",1
"i took it straight out of the package, plugged it in for a charge.  charger never reached ""green"" ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later.customer service was not the best i've had.  don't make the same mistake, keep looking",0
"if you are shoting kid at the swiming pool, it's ok. but,if you are the open water diver, please don't buy it. i try it yesterday, it will not work after 10m/33ft, it will show the red screen and count down timer, it scare me. and i miss a lot of shot for yesterday's dive. it's really disappointed to me",0
"cons only, no pros:the velcro closure is week and opens easilyterrible lookthe side zippers are a mistery, totally uselessno space for extra memory or batteryattaches only to a very small beltthe flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash",0
"overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your panasonic lx1 or lx2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  first, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  there is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2"" wide.  also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  this might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use.",0
"i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder. unfortunately, everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the ""ancient"" sony.  the color is not nearly as sharp, the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long.  the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself. the camera's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer's editing program.the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack. this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights. it uses a toggle to control the exposure and, while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony, it is adequate.  unfortunately, it functions so poorly in low light it wouldn't provide adequate color in an auditorium.i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony. maybe it's because the camera is so small it's hard to keep as stable as the larger sony.video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony's digital 8. if you don't have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera, i'd recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250. if you do have to have a minidv camera and you won't be shooting in bright sunlight, try another brand.this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day. otherwise, i'll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality",1
try to call panasonic customer service @1-800-973-4264 and tell them you have question about your camcorder first. panasonic service is the worst one in this world.,0
"straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  plug into wall and does not work.  after trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  after putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  the mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and i was only playing very quiet jazz.  this is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  pay a little more and get one that is of better quality",0
i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it.  the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels).  i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all.  overall don't waste your time and money,1
"i've just returned this unit. it doesn't play videos as advertised.  i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later. i have now had 3 different brands of 8"" photo frames in my possession: a phillips, a pandigital, and this coby.i have developed the following list of features in my ""ideal"" photo frame. first, video playback: i've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along, and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov, more later) i'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is, to play movie clips in show presentations, intermixed with .jpg photo files.second feature is to play .wma music files, in addition to mp3. this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player. all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3.third, i would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning, off at night, for example.fourth, i'd like an audio or speaker out feature. none of these frames has home theater-like sound, and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i'd probably hook up. video out could come in handy too.fifth, i'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software, manually or automatically. yes, you can rotate them in the computer, but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (this may depend on which photo edit program you are using.)sixth, i'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. especially with the huge chips now available, i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder), rather than switching out chips.here is where the 3 units i've had stack up, followed by my next (fourth) unit. i am keeping the pandigital....which costco has for $140. it plays .mov video files, but not within a slideshow. it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. it requires mp3 music files. it permits picture rotation.  no folder management system. no clock/timer. no ability to play stills/video intermixed. i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok.the phillips didn't play video, and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.)the coby won't play my videos, even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations. the coby plays .wma music files, won't rotate stills, has no folder system, no clock/timer. it has a speaker out jack. it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. picture quality is fully equal to philips, generally the recognized standard. if all you want is photos, and never turn your camera sideways, this unit will be a good value.another unit i'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci. i've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos.",1
"my primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. the camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). the camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. i believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.i used to have a cannon powershot sd450 that was awesome, but it was stolen and so i needed a replacement. i had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900. i am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose, this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. instead, i just got a fuji finepix f30, which is supposed to be better without the flash. we'll see",1
"""lens error, restart camera"" message appears today (mar 26) after buying production on amazon on feb 20, 07. when i searched google for this error message saw thousands of canon users having similar error / e18 error with older and newer version of the canon. i have tried panasonic and sonys before and never had an issue. i dread that canon customer service is going to waste my hours in getting a replacement and ultimately may end up charging me over a 100 for repairs like they have done to other users(after reading user feedback on web)",0
"huge problems with the lcd screen, two cameras within one month after purchase showed the lcd ""shattered."" one has already been shipped for service and the other one will be going in tomorrow.  sure it is easy to use and produces great pictures, but the lcd problem is a definite negative.",0
i just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great.  but today i tried to turn it on and it's completely dead!  i even changed out the batteries and it's still completely dead.  this is the first digital camera i've had and i bought it because i'm going to europe (two days after it died).  now i have to scramble to get a replacement before i take off.  grrrrr!!,0
"i bought a 743 for the wife for christmas. i had a 6330 that i was very happy with. so a 743 should be better right? every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. we finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! after several e mails they told me to call service. i got someone in india that could not understand me and i had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. they made it very dificult to get it sent in. i sent it in today, but i do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. i hope it comes back at least.",1
"i recommend not to purchase this item.  look for another one.the lens itself seems ok, although i can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal.  the adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released.  this would be great, except for two very important things.  one, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. this causes some major distortion, especially when moving.  two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable.  in fact it is so cheaply thin that i am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. one drop, even a small one, and it is done for",1
"i bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak z700. i  loved my z700, even though it was only 4mp and didn't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have. i figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6mp would be a no-brainer, but i was disappointed in 2 major areas. first, the lag time is so slow on the c653, when i took pictures of my kids i rarely got what i was expecting to see. the smile or look that i saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures. we experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference. the other disappointing area was low-light picture quality. anything i shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit. every background was grainy. terrible. using the low-light settings fixed the problem, but then your subject is blurry because you're not in ""sports"" or ""kids"" mode anymore (which we used all the time with the z700 for taking pics of the kids). on my z700 (which is only $150 now), i could set it and forget it. set it to ""action"", and it took perfect pics indoors, or out, moving or stationary. that's what i thought i was getting in the c653, but i was wrong. i ended up returning the camera",0
"grainy iso 100 pictures at any light conditions. usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem, but if you take pictures with panasonic dmc-fz7 and compare ... it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera.i had panasonic dmc-fz7 and the only cons. is really noisy high iso sensitivity mode.in fz8 camera panasonic implemented the venus iii processor (fz7 has venus ii processor). as a result picture quality really improved at high iso sensitivity modes but dramatically changed for the worse in iso 100 mode",1
this is a poor excuse for a lens coming from canon.  can only be used at a certain zoom or you will get a circular ring around the photo.  please do not waste your money like i did,1
"i am a novice photographer, so take this with a grain of salt...  i just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components.  i suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits, putting them together must seem self-explanatory.  if you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating.  it is also frustrating to discover smith victor does not have a support site (just references on photography).  they do not even provide a support # or address.  keep all this in mind when considering something from this company",0

me and my wife bought the jvc camcorder and burner set up to send dvd's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time. at first it worked great then after 2-3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc. we have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10. we returned it to get another and it did the same thing. we thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal. i do not recommend this to anyone,0
we returned this item.  it was a glorified external dvd burner.  it was not worth the money,1
"i own many sony products, including a sony cybershot dsc-f717, which i love. however, i am very disappointed by this camera, the sony cybershot dsc-t5.i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present. it is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.however, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: (1) there is horrible red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in many pictures. the so-called ""red-eye reduction"" setting does nothing.(2) dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. night-time photography is impossible.these problems are not unique to our camera... you will find many corroborating reviews above.overall, i am very disappointed in this camera, and wish i could exchange it for something else.do not buy this camera. other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras).",1

"not seeing many reviews, i'm writing this as a warning. this mic is horrible. i bought it to get rid of the &quot;motor noise&quot; from my canon optura pi, as many others have. when i listen now, the sound is much worse. you can barely hear people speak over the loud humming... this mic is horrible",0
"i bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera. the night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible. it snaps and pops all night long and i have to move it all around to find ""just the right spot"".i actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise. i live in a single story 2100 sq. foot house. i should have returned it right away, but i kept it because i had no other monitor at the time. now, 10 months later, the volume control does not work anymore! i am now trying to find a new monitor. i love having the video monitor though, so i will look for a different brand",1
"i received this monitor as a baby shower gift, but it was something i had particularly wanted.  i was extremely disappointed when i found it didn't work at all!  there is so much sound interference it's impossible to tell if the noises are the baby or the interference.  we disconnected every electronic appliance in the house (cordless phone, microwave, even turned off our cell phones) and still the interference was there.  the video reception is awful, supposed to be up to 300 feet, we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible. i swear it was supposed to have ""night vision"" - forget it, non-existent.  i'm off the video monitoring; i'm on-line now to buy an old-fashioned voice monitor",0
"because the camera eye moves only in one direction, the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby's bed. you have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib (older child can crawl away from the view) or see just a part of it. we have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad. we went with graco's excellent digital imonitor.",1
very dissappointed.  my son (i bought this for them) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used.  audio just static and noise.i did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might not work.  try telling this to me before i purchase thank you.  this is the last i purchase equipment on-line.  i will stick to books thank you very much,1
"this monitor worked pretty well for 4 months. we purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver. however, when we were downstairs (baby's room upstairs next to our's) the monitor was fuzzy, and had static and lines running thru. we were still able to have audio recpetion. after 4 months, the picture disappeared, audio was still operational. not a good camera for long term",1
"this camera has a very poor lens. at 1x zoom, the barrel/spherical distortion is enormous; try taking a picture of a tiled wall. image quality is also so-so when a picture is viewed at 100%; scaled down on a computer monitor, the quality is ok. color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance.

"review:unit had a very large defect in the field of view. it's not one of the usual spots from the intensifier tube; those i am aware of as i have other night vision devices. this goes about 1/4 of the way across, near the center. had to return it. poor quality control.update - the new one does not have any image defects. it also doesn't focus as sharply as the first one did (or my other one does), but it isn't too bad",1
"it never worked as advertised and total quit working after about two months. don't buy, you've been warned",0
"i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years. i was extremely happy with my olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting. this camera was such a disappointment. just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it. (this only happened when using the flash. i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. the first digital camera i ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! the store i bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy. so, i sold the camera and took a $100 loss. i'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera",1
"there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website.  ""if there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  however, this is not a malfunction.""  read:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  sony does not think this is a problem.  it is a design flaw.if you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!",1
"i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago.  i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""digital voice editor"".  sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  only patches of the software are available to download.the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  think twice before making your buying decision.",0
"this is an awesome little camera.  except that you can't use it at night!  there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  it's a known problem [...]also, it's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology.  as a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of usb??!!), and you have to buy a sony memory stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  on the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.but other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  the lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as i could tell, quality was good.in the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??",1
"the leather case has a magnetc latch, the magnetic force is strong enough for an sd card to stick onto it.  i have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire, but i decided not to chance it. i am surprised that canon cautions against placing the camera in strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature!although constructed of fine leather, the case is also very bulky, making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse.the neck strap is ok, it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing, making it look quite cheap and stiff, again increasing the bulk of the camera.the battery works fine, but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money",1

when it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50% of the time if i was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher.  it seemed to become less effective each time i used it to the point that now i'm lucky to get a reading 10% of the time.  it still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless.,0
"if you're looking to capture ""the decisive moment"" with the nikon coolpix 8400, stop---do not buy this camera!!! for that matter, carefully check any digicam or other camera with which you want to capture ""action,"" because what you think you see,  may not be what the camera has the ability to capture as an image.let me briefly explain where i'm coming from: i made my living as a field photojournalist for 40 years. by the time i retired out of the business i had probably created something like a million color and b&w film images. i owned and used mostly nikon equipment all those years (although i sure liked working with leica rangefinder cameras and short focal length lenses), starting with the original nikon f slr (which i still have) and finishing up with the n90s and probably ten different lenses of varying focal lengths. i like nikon equipment a lot.i decided to begin working with digital images last year. i was attracted to the coolpix 8400 because the ""spread"" on the zoom lens was the 35mm camera equivalent of 24mm--85mm. when i worked with film i probably used my 24mm and 105mm nikkors more than any others in my bag, so this little coolpix beauty had just about what i was looking for in one package.let me say that while the problems with the viewfinder and shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless for editorial photojournalism, it is, nevertheless, a marvel of human ingenuity. for many other uses---such as taking pictures of fire hydrants or cows standing in a pasture (put another way, things that don't move), it works wonderfully well. seriously, i shot an assignment here in tucson that was essentially architectual in nature. the images can only be described as superb (if i do say so myself). i worked only with the camera and a tripod on the shoot. working inside i simply changed the light balance within the menu on the 8400 (which you can pretty much do on any digital camera these days), did not have to check the scene with a separate exposure meter, etc. point being that with film i often carried a bunch of light balancing filters and sometimes a separate gossen exposure meter and all sorts of lights to shoot an assignment. even then, i'd sweat blood until i could get the processed film on a light table. of course with digital, i (you) don't have to worry about any of that stuff. one can check the image immediately and know instantly if you're good to go.alas, the shutter lag on this, and many other digital cameras made these days, is the ""downcheck"" which makes me unable to recommend the 8400. there is also the delay in the electronic viewfinder to deal with. the combination of shutter and viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible to capture an image, the precise composition of which lasts only a split-second. i have taken many good pictures of people working, ""action"" shots and the like, but it was only by taking large numbers of images of any given activity and then retaining the one or two that said what i intended that i achieved my purpose. essentially, my shooting eye (which is pretty damned good) had nothing to with it. it's like a soldier trying to kill an enemy with a machine-gun---if he fires enough rounds, one of them is going to hit the other guy. marksmanship has nothing to do with it.  same-same shooting with electronic viewfinders and shutter lag. if you shoot enough images, statistically you're probably going to get a good one. but it's not a very good way to do things. so if you're looking to capture what henri cartier-bresson (i'm not sure i've spelled his name correctly) so artfully described as ""the decisive moment,"" look at a digital single-lens reflexes, or wait for improvements in digicams.",1
"some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all, but the nikon 8400 has a ""electronic viewfinder"" and the reviews have been good and the price is great, so i bought the camera.the electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash, you cannot see any expressions, just the outline of the person's head, so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder.  outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot. the ""display"" lcd monitor is small and washes out in sunlight.the background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark.after 3 days of use and 90 shots i mailed it back to ""ritz on amazon"" this morning, dec 5.  they require it back ""within 10 days of receipt of purchase"", their ""date of order"" was nov 29 and it arrived at my house on dec 3.  it's a good thing i already had a compact flash card to use, there is not one in the box and if i had waited for the one i ordered to arrive, well, it's not here yet.  it cost me $11.65 to return it, insured, with 2 day delivery and a ""delivery confirmation receipt"".the camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses, but with only a short time to try it out before the ""10 days"" ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what i was shooting i gave up on it",1
"it fits in the s1, but it doesn't always charge -- the contacts arent the same size as the oem version.  when it doesn't charge i just re-insert the batter and it works, but its sort of a bummer",0
i am not satisfied by this product. the calrity is not good. also this is the most battery consuming device i have ever seen,0
"i was very happy with the previous model dsc-n1, which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting. but this one, while i only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather, it really disappointed me. the pictures are always blured due to too much exposure, i used auto flash, for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it  is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1mp! i'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible i will return it, i just can't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes. i doubt i was unlucky and got a bad one, i can't believe a 10.1mp sony camera takes so poor pictures. and after reading the previous review about the terrible sony custmer servce, i decide i will avoid sony customer service, and the camera will just be returned.  note: found the review by cecelia choy ""cece"" on march 13, 2007 mentioned the same problem i had. i didn't have this problem with my previous model dsc-n1. april 17, 2006: i bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now! suggestion for those having the same problem i had before -- exchange for another one!!",0
"i ordered two of the items above in error.  i did not think the first order was submitted properly so therefore a second one was ordered and came from antonline.  i have been trying since dec. 19 to return the wide angle lens and adapter to them.  i am 71 years old and not computer savvy.  i just wish i could get return labels and my account credited.  they are still in the original packing as received and never been opened.  thank you for being interested. i was informed by them that my time had expired.  i do not believe this to be true, or does your opening web page not apply to them.",1
"when mated to a sony wide-angle lens, the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo. a major flaw in my opinion.sony makes no mention of this on the packaging",0
"i had high hopes for this battery for my nikon camera.  it promised more mah than the oem battery that came with the camera.  unfortunately, it must be leaking electrons all over the place, since a charge in this model does not compare to the original.  i would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original nikon battery.  the price was cheap and you get what you pay for.  if you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other.  cheers",1
"if you want a quality product, this ain't it.  the dreaded ""remove the cassette"" error is true and in full force.  don't take my word for it, search the net and find the hundreds, upon thousands of unhappy consumers who purchased this piece of junk and discovered it the hard way.  i highly suggest the panasonic ag-dvx100.  it costs a bit more, but well worth it.before reading other reviews, make sure that they are comparing the gl-2 to another cam, like tony l. shores.  he compares the canon gl-piece-of-junk-2 to the sony hdr-fx1.  sure, the sony is much better, but it is also a high-definition cam.  if you want hd, check out the panasonic ag-hvx200.do your research, read the reviews",1
i bought this over the sony and i regret it.  i get a tape eject error every time i try to rewind.  i can only rewind at 10 second intervals before i get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again.  that's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape.  many canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired.  canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item.  i will never buy canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem,0
"my primary camera is a sony hdr-fx1.i bought the gl-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events.the gl-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the sony.the price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera.however, beware of the rebate offer.i sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected.the rebate facilitator claimed i did not include the upc code.if i had it to do over, i would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second sony",1
"i bought this item as a gift, and it ended up becoming mine. i have to say, i am greatly dissatisfied. here are some main issues i am having with the camera:1. it is very poorly designed. the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. buttons are really ugly, and operating the camera is awkward, and for some functions requires both hands to   operate..2. the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally.3. the worst, by far, is the picture quality. colors are just plain terrible. automatic settings are a disaster of photography. i have used a canon (2mp) before getting this one (5mp). the canon was far superior in quality, colors, lighting.. i don't need large files of trash, i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures.as a result, i am strongly recommending getting a different camera. i have had great experiences with canon; and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too. but hp must stop making cameras, and indeed many other devices.",1
"this camera took some great pictures, and i enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  i was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when i was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  the camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  the end.  the lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  this was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  i will not buy hp cameras again",1
"i loved the camera, absolutely loved it.  i was using it one night and it died.  i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened.  the light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  the second time i used it, i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  as i was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.  i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine.",1
i purchased a canon camera carrying case that came with an extra battery and uv filtering lense. the case came within a few days and is perfect for what i needed. smooth fast transaction. five star,1
"i had an older canon camcorder that i was very happy with, so i decided to get this new one. i ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud. i even tried the same model at best buy to make sure it wasn't just a defective camera. but compared to a similar sony model, the canon was noticeably louder while operating. way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions",1
"i have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my jvc gr-d70u, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  after much study and evaluation, i chose the canon zr800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my ""must-have"" options).  after returning home, i read the review by miamian ""new reviewer"", and felt trepidation.  after charging the battery, i tried the camera.  lo and behold, miamian is right.  there is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my jvc.  hoping against hope, i played the tape back, and, just as i feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  this is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the tv when watching.  it rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. i took the camcorder back, and, like miamian, ordered the sony dch-hc38.  (i know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, i give up!! why don't they make more cameras with them??)the plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out, and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book.  the joystick selector is so easy to use, to select play, rewind, fast forward, stop, pause in the playback mode,  and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes.  the wide screen viewfinder (lcd) is so nice to use, and easy to see, all others (in 4:3) become passe'.i didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera, due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit.  the picture looked ok; it did not greatly impress me, however, and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback.in essence, caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing.  others watching and listening to the tape will not be",1
"i was attracted to the cannon zr800 due to the very small size and very low cost.  however, you get what you pay for, although you get much more in other brands for just a little increase in cost.  i've already returned my cannon zr800 and replaced it with the sony dcr-hc38.  the smallest problem with the canon is the continued motor noise, which you should be aware of it if you have read any review for any of the zr800 predecessors.  the problem is that the motor is very loud, and you will hear a very annoying whirr if you are indoors.  this could be forgivable given the low cost, but the problem with the zoom noise is not.  when you zoom in and out, a very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go of the zoom switch.  it is a loud click and when you play back your video this click is amplified on your video.  it is impossible to watch a video and not notice this click.  it is annoying, unusual and a big flaw with these new zr cannon camcorders.  i called technical support, the person took a zr800 and tried it out and then acknowledged that a problem does exist (she seemed stunned that this noise was occuring).  bottom line, this camcorder is absolutely unusable due to this clicking noise and would not be worth using even if it were free.  do not but it.btw, i love the sony dch-hc38 which is a bit more expensive and, like the zr800, just recently came onto the market.",0
"i found the same problem that other users of this product experienced.  particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot.  i found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash.  this leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated ""flipping"" of the flash that some other users have reported.  the item is manufactured by stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called ""gadget infinity"" under the listing title of ""flash bracket with 90 degrees camera rotate feature"".  buy it now price is $29.99.  i just bought one and it arrived yesterday and i could not be happier.  pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years",0
"this is the worst camera i've ever owned. i'm not exaggerating. i'm so upset for wasting money on it. the only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. it takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. the video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. my friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. it just plain sucks.",0
"i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago.  i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""digital voice editor"".  sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  only patches of the software are available to download.  the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  think twice before making your buying decision.",0
"this is another example of how sony is alienating its customer base. not only will it not work with standard sd memory like everyone else, it does not include a docking station.  you have to shell out more money for that option.  i dont think so",1
the reviews are worthless unless the writer mentions the model of device they are using the batteries for. fifty percent of the reviews here don't mention what they were using the batteries for. do this service justice and mention the type and model equipment for which the battereis are utilized,1
"pros: great resolution. nice packaging. excellent door stop. cons: stopped working after 3 weeks. horrible overall quality. no customer support what so ever since i didn't have a receipt (ebay purchase). tried contacting the ebay seller for receipt, never got a response now i'm stuck with a 360 dollar dead weight.  tried contacting pacificdigital they offered a none warranty repair for $199.  becareful what you purchase on ebay specially pacificdigital products.",0
"i can't say for sure that my experience was typical, but i can say that it was horrible.the short version is:  i had to return it once for a screen failure, then i had to return the replacement for a screen failure (and a refund).in between the returns, i spent a significant amount of time on the phone with customer support.  the manual was inadequate, especially for the wireless stuff.  i also had problems with windows (network bridging, i think) that further complicated things.for the brief time the two units worked, i was pleased.  the picture quality was good, and once running, i had no problems with the software.i take a lot of digital photos.  this would have been the perfect compliment.i gave the memory frame two stars (instead of one) because, in between failures and configuration problems, i was pleased with the quality of the display.too bad i couldn't say the same about the quality control.",0
"the e550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens.  so this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out.  as long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful.   i unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight",0
i haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. i have a fujifilm e550 camera which cost is usd 250.00 by this date. this lens cost is usd 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra usd 20.00. that means you will pay usd 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. for that price or less you can get a +10x slr like camera like the fujifilm s5100 or s5200.,1
"i loved this camera when i got it.but after three months the lens would not close.  it makes grinding noises,the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again.  i am very disappointed in this camera",1
"the en-el3a is a works fine and with no problems.  however, amazon is misleading its customers by putting a lower price from a partner company as the primary price of the item.  amazon should market the item at it's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner.  the 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon's misleading advertisment",0
just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted. never used. returned it,1
"well. i was convinced the fx07 was a bad product after using it for 6 months. like a lot of other reviews have pointed out, the noise level in low-light condition is annoying, and give you a watercolor-like effect. some pictures i took during a visit to monterey bay aquarium turned out completely dark (to prevent this beforehand, i even took photos of the same objects using several different settings, only to get the results of bad, worse, and worst). the picture quality is nowhere close to my old old old sony cybershot t7. i was totally disappointed. if not for my t7 was broken, i wouldn't even wanna use this camera. even re-sell it to other people, i would feel it's like a crime.after revisiting this webpage and read more user reviews, i realized i must have got the defective item from amazon. well. what can i say? it's been 6 months. bottom line: just be careful when you received this item. do some test shots. if anything looks suspicious, ask for a replacement. after all, all the high praise here can't be all wrong",0
"it looks cool and it's easy to carry, but that is about it.  camera is slow and pictures are often blurry.  sorry i wasted my money on this one.  get one of the new ones with vr so you don't have that issue.",0
the nikon camera s3 is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture. it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk.,1
"i used to have an canon elura 70, which was an excellent camcorder but the firewire transfer didn't work so i decided to replace it with the elura 100 only to find that canon had discontinued the elura line. i really wanted an elura for the improved video quality over the low-end zr models. so as a compromise i purchased the zr 850 which has a 1mp ccd, not a good as the elura (1.3mp) but better than the other zr's (.640mp). the video quality wasn't bad but the motor noise was so loud i couldn't believe it. i returned the first one but the replacement was just as bad. this isn't a minor hum in the background i'm talking about, its a full-on whine! i also found the zr camera to be difficult to handle with my small-ish hands and the video stabilisation was a bit disappointing. luckily i could return both cameras without incurring a restocking fee and found a reconditioned elura 100 that is much more satisfactory. its a mystery to me how canon can produce two markedly different cameras (quality wise) in the same price range and opt to phase out the better one",1
"i really like the size and weight of the camera.  it is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good.  i had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable.  i recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable, even outdoors.  all the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on.  i will spend a bit more money and get the sony hcr-dc96 instead",1
the camera is decent. the fact that it doesn't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable.  what do they expect 90% of consumers are going to do with it,0

"this camera is a decent enough camera, compact, easy to use and takes good quality video and still pictures and the battery life is excellent.  the battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour.  i acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so i never worry about running out of juice.  i have only two complaints really, one minor and one major. the minor complaint is the fiddly little controls on the touch screen lcd viewfinder. i find i need to use my reading glasses to see what i'm doing.the major complaint is transfering video to my computer via the ilink cable (not supplied).  i have never persuaded it to work.  by browsing various camera fora on the web i am finding a complaint identical to mine with this model in particular as well as other sony models.  the computer will recognize the camera in usb mode (for capturing still pictures from the memory stick) but does not see it at all when plugged in via ilink (firewire/ieee 1394).  all indications are that my firewire port and cable are perfectly ok.  sony tech support, both web chat based and phone, have no clue and because i am out of warranty it will cost a flat $210 to send it in and have them take a look at it.   if all you want to do is connect the camera to your tv to playback the video you take, it's a good camera.  if video capture an editing is what you have in mind, buyer beware. because of this, i can only give the product 2 stars, other wise it would be a 5.update:  i installed a new firewire pci card on my computer and using a new cable tried the video capture again.  i also tried the camera on my neighbor's mac (on the theory that if a mac won't recognize it you really know you have a problem).  the computer still won't recognize the camera.  this camera has been used very little and definitely not abused.  it was probably defective right out of the box and it appears to be a common problem.  if you buy this, make sure you test all of its capabilities as soon as you get it.  don't wait like i did because i'm out of warranty and it will cost me to get the problem fixed",1
i returned this camera after trying very hard to like.  picture quality (movie or still) is totally unacceptable.  i did not even get one good still picture.  forget about indoors video or still.  the falsh and video light are useless.  the overall quality of the camera is low.,0

"the panasonic is very compact, very stylish sexy as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa.the colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. if one investigates such things, will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as sony's, canon improves this to 180, and nikon is at 300 dpi. it is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format, take the photos, pop the sd card  into the computer, compare the images in photoshop. enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. that is what i did, since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too",0
"i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  in the end, it came down to panasonic's fx01 and cannon's sd600.  i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic's images weren't top quality, but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600.  i was wrong.after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  i really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01!  very disappointing.  i ended up returning this camera to amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  i mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  i know someone with the sd600 and he's very happy with the quality.  judging by the customer images on the sd600's page on amazon, i think i should've gone with cannon",1
"i just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the c743 camera.  the battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger.  i think it's odd, as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock.  i'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery.  i don't know whether the dock works okay, because i didn't get that far.  this is my second easyshare camera and dock and i was very happy with the first one.  now i have to buy another battery",0
"straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  plug into wall and does not work.  after trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  after putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  the mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and i was only playing very quiet jazz.  this is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  pay a little more and get one that is of better quality",0
"i bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work.  i didn't really have high expectations for it, because it was so inexpensive.  as soon as it was turned on i had the following problems:1) five seconds after i turn it on, it always says ""usb connected!""-- and i don't have a usb cable inserted into it!  this also freezes the device.  i found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted.2) i cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual.  my computer does recognize the usb device, but when i try to copy files over to the frame, i get a ""path is not found"" error.3) i thought i could live with the above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures.  so i used a card reader to load .jpg files onto a cf card at 400x300 resolution. when, i plugged the card into the frame, these files show up as ""invalid"" when i try to view them.emailed coby with the 3 bullet points above, got a response 30 hours later saying: ""coby tech support to me5:25 am (3 hours ago) hello,we have received your inquiry. it appears that your unit is defective. return the unit to the retailer for an exchange.""what an inconvenience and disappointment.  i will be buying a different product",0
i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it.  the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels).  i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all.  overall don't waste your time and money,1
"i've just returned this unit. it doesn't play videos as advertised.  i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later. i have now had 3 different brands of 8"" photo frames in my possession: a phillips, a pandigital, and this coby.i have developed the following list of features in my ""ideal"" photo frame. first, video playback: i've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along, and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov, more later) i'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is, to play movie clips in show presentations, intermixed with .jpg photo files.second feature is to play .wma music files, in addition to mp3. this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player. all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3.third, i would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning, off at night, for example.fourth, i'd like an audio or speaker out feature. none of these frames has home theater-like sound, and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i'd probably hook up. video out could come in handy too.fifth, i'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software, manually or automatically. yes, you can rotate them in the computer, but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (this may depend on which photo edit program you are using.)sixth, i'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. especially with the huge chips now available, i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder), rather than switching out chips.here is where the 3 units i've had stack up, followed by my next (fourth) unit. i am keeping the pandigital....which costco has for $140. it plays .mov video files, but not within a slideshow. it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. it requires mp3 music files. it permits picture rotation.  no folder management system. no clock/timer. no ability to play stills/video intermixed. i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok.the phillips didn't play video, and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.)the coby won't play my videos, even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations. the coby plays .wma music files, won't rotate stills, has no folder system, no clock/timer. it has a speaker out jack. it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. picture quality is fully equal to philips, generally the recognized standard. if all you want is photos, and never turn your camera sideways, this unit will be a good value.another unit i'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci. i've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos.",1
"be careful ordering this item - make sure it's the right one for your camera.  while it says it's for the a95, it isn't.  while it doesn't say in the header that it's the la-dc52c, it is, and the a95 camera requires the la-dc52d.  i had to return the wrong one and reorder the right one.  i purchased the wrong one based on amazon's direction when purchasing accessories and don't want others to make the same mistake",0
"if you are looking to take high quality pictures, then look elsewhere. it is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you, but not much else. (or for a beginner in photography or a child.) you have to hold very still if you don't want your pictures to come out blurry. also, the flash makes images far too bright and if you don't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark.the only thing i like about this camera is it's size. it's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag...anyway, i'm buying a better one soon",1
"we just bought this camera to replace our minidv jvc-dvl500 that was bought in 2000. in short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is very grainy and dark. i applied the workaround listed above, but found that i had to set the frame rate to 1/15 in order to ge the brightness that i needed which caused a very jittery image. the quality of this camera is something that i would expect for $200, needless to say i am returning this camera today",1
i returned this item.  i have not received notice that they did receive it back so i will have to wait and see if my credit card account is credited,1
just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted. never used. returned it,1

"after being an amature photographer via print film, i decided to try a digital camera - though i've been leary about printing quality.  i knew i couldn't afford a digital slr, so i opted for a ""snap shot"" camera that i thought would have enough features to satisfy me.  however, after having and using this camera for a year now, i am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout.  after being used to print and picture quality in my film slr (cannon, i might add), i was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, i wish i would have just saved my money for a digital slr.",0
"i purchased this case for my dscs90. i hate it! it is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else. there is no handle to the case, in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle. the zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so i don't recommend doing this. look for a better case for your new camera.",0
"i bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste.  the camera was much smaller than expected, trying to figure out what mode you're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret. nothing is a simple ""one step"" procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children.  i was so frustrated setting it up that i didn't bother giving it to her.  the software installed okay but was also far from ""kid friendly"".  i wish i would've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase. ironically, the reviews i did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids.  i believe you'd be better off purchasing a ""regular"" inexpensive digital camera for your potential ""shutterbugs"".",1
"my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco. we put new batteries in that morning. the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset. when i tried to download the pictures to my computer, they were all gone, and the battery icon was flashing. based on what i've read here, it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased. the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor, but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy. but what good is that when there aren't even any pictures the next day. i'm hoping the store will take it back",1
"at least if your going to decieve people about the lcd screen in the back, at least make the picture quality decent.  i mean this barely qualifies as a picture.  some pictures are so bright it just looks like a splash of light.  this was sickening to me because my daughter was excited and it broke her heart when i had to return it because she expected to at least be able to see the pictures.  definatly stay away from this camera",1
"this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market.  after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures.  the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download.  it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child.  the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up.  even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver (the smallest one you can find) to achieve it.  unfortunately, i have wasted my money but luckily you don't have to",0
"first, i want to defend this camera's lack of an lcd viewscreen--really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point.what's wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it doesn't do the one thing it needs to do well--i.e., take a picture with the push of a button.this product would be much better if you took out all the settings (what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera, for crying out loud?) and simply put in an auto-flash.  as it is, you must consult the manual, push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash (which is not intuitive, so you'll need to carry the manual with you), press the shutter button to turn the flash on, wait for the little red light to come on, and then you can take a picture.  then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity, and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it all over again!oh, and did i mention that it won't take a picture if there isn't enough light (there wasn't even in the brightest room in my house), so you must use the flash?clearly, the makers of this product did not test it on real children.  heck, my digital camera is easier to use than this!  we never even got to see the picture quality--after trying to get it to even take a picture, i knew this was going back to the store asap",1
"this was a waste of money.  my 5 year old loves taking photos.  she uses my digital camera  sometimes.    i  thought this would be a great gift for  her.  she could  see the photos on the back of the camera like  mom's.  this was not the case.   the lcd does not  project the images  and it is so small  you  can not read what mode you are in. if the batteries run  out, it erases the  photos. i think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly.  my daughter  was frustrated  quickly and  it has laid  in  the  drawer  for 3  months.if your child  likes to take  photos, i would invest in something  else",1
"overall, i was entirely disappointed with this camaera.  the packaging and description were deceiving.  there was no view finding screen, only a teeny, tiny window as in a regular camera.  this was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera.  i bought it because i wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen.  the construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground.  i would not recommend this to anyone",0
i found it on sale- luckily because it did not work. cute as the dickens and came with a great strap and the art program was fun for the kids- but no go on the camera. never able to get it to power up- yes fresh batteries too. we were very disappointed :,1

i bought this item for $40 online and then found out my canon camera didnt need a cannon brand charger and i could have bought one for $10 instead. in total i spent for this charger which included the shipping and handling. not worth it. go to another store and by one for $10,0
excelent product.i get about 15 times the life of ordinary batteries. i would reccomend to anybody who uses their camera a lo,1
"i own many sony products, including a sony cybershot dsc-f717, which i love. however, i am very disappointed by this camera, the sony cybershot dsc-t5.i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present. it is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.however, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: (1) there is horrible red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in many pictures. the so-called ""red-eye reduction"" setting does nothing.(2) dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. night-time photography is impossible.these problems are not unique to our camera... you will find many corroborating reviews above.overall, i am very disappointed in this camera, and wish i could exchange it for something else.do not buy this camera. other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras).",1

"this microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the sony hdr-hc7 video camera on most websites, including sonystyle.  while the microphone may be of good quality (i didn't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it), it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the hdr-hc7.  the microphone does plug into the mic jack on the camera and appears to work, but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera.  (note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back, at which point it's probably too late to make a correction.)  after nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and, finally, direct conversation with a sony technician, i learned that there is a ""jury-rigged"" bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod.  otherwise, there is no way to fix it to the camera.  the sony technician finally admitted that it was "" curious"" that sony lists this as a compatible microphone.  if you have a sony hdr-hc7, choose a different microphone!",0
"i ordered this mic after having to return the ecmhs1 (because it was, in reality, totally non-directional).  well, this one actually is directional, but it is such a pain to use i wish i never bought it.1st of all, you should know this mic does not work with the ""smart shoe"" available on most sony camcorders - this means it will not receive any power from or transfer sound data to the camcorder through the shoe.  therefore it is battery powered.  this may seem like a minor problem, but it means you need to remember to turn it on and off each time you video, otherwise you will have either a soundless video or a dead battery.  believe me, at some point you will forget this.not being smart shoe compatible also means you have to plug the mic into a jack on the camcorder - this can be a real hassle if you have a small device and are trying to loop the cord around so it isn't in the way.  (in my case the jack is under a rather cheap plastic cover that threatens to break off with repeated use.)(as you might expect, i highly recommend you check whether a mic is smart shoe compatible.  of course, that means the mic doesn't need a battery or audio plug - not that it will simply fit into the shoe.  it's a great feature.)finally, while the engineers at sony have done some amazing things over the years, they weren't able to do even a half-decent job designing the cap that covers this mic's battery.  this cap will fall off with even the slightest touch.  this can be incredibly annoying.  mine fell off several times - fortunately i always managed to find it.  i finally put a piece of duct tape on to secure it (doesn't look great, but at least the color matches).considering the high cost, this mic is a really bad investment.  while the non-directional mics in most camcorders are pretty pathetic, this is a very poor substitute.",1

"i got this lens in a kit with a nikon d80 camera.  this lens failed to deliver the goods 99% of the time.  why buy an expensive camera and then use a cheap lens like this?  its silly to spend big money on the camera and have only blurry pictures to show from it.  it was only tolerable in very bright situations and using less than 100mm focal length.  a cloudly day or all of the 200 mm zoom would result in a picture that had significant distortion noticeable even on little 4x6 prints.  very few pictures came out when it was used in the fullest zoom (200mm).  i disliked this lens enough to return the entire camera kit and purchase a different camera (d200) that came with the highly ranked 18-200 vr lens from nikon.  if your interested in nice sharp pics, then pass on this lens.  if you want to save a few bucks and like blurry photos, this lens is for you..",1
"this adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my a700, so much so that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identicalto that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens.thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter. canon, normally aresponsible firm with many excellent products, is beneath contempt in marketingthis lens.  i called canon customer service and spoke with a sympatheticrepresentative who took the matter up with ""someone else"".  the outcome was thatthey admit that there ""is very little increase"" in the non-vignetted field of viewby using this adapter.  she said she would put my comments on a company-internalproblem compilation called ""customer voice"".  i can only hope it reaches someonehigh enough to do some good",1
"after receiving the case and trying to use it on the camera, i discovered it was very cumbersome and almost impossible to manipulate.  for instance, you cannot access the cf card or camera with the attached portion screwed into the tripod mount, also, taking the front cover off to take a picture was a hassle.  this is not useable for a carry-around use.i have it sitting in the corner of my office unused, spent good money for nothing.",0
"bought this case along with a digital rebel xti, my first slr. instead of the 18-55mm kit lens i opted for the sigma 17-70mm lens. sad to say, but the case fits only with the kit lens.. the rebel xti with the 17-70mm lens barely fits.so a word of cuation to everyone, if you're planning on anything other than the kit lens, then don't get this",0
this is a poorly designed camera case.  you have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures. i expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot. i was very disappointed. this is rather a leather box than a camera case,0
"i own many sony products, including a sony cybershot dsc-f717, which i love. however, i am very disappointed by this camera, the sony cybershot dsc-t5.i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present. it is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside.however, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident: (1) there is horrible red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in many pictures. the so-called ""red-eye reduction"" setting does nothing.(2) dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. night-time photography is impossible.these problems are not unique to our camera... you will find many corroborating reviews above.overall, i am very disappointed in this camera, and wish i could exchange it for something else.do not buy this camera. other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras).",1
"bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. panasonic will not warranty fix this! if you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. if you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. this is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up ""bricking"" a brand new camera. i am replacing mine with a canon",1
"the panasonic is very compact, very stylish sexy as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa.the colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. if one investigates such things, will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as sony's, canon improves this to 180, and nikon is at 300 dpi. it is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format, take the photos, pop the sd card  into the computer, compare the images in photoshop. enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. that is what i did, since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too",0
"i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  in the end, it came down to panasonic's fx01 and cannon's sd600.  i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic's images weren't top quality, but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600.  i was wrong.after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  i really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01!  very disappointing.  i ended up returning this camera to amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  i mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  i know someone with the sd600 and he's very happy with the quality.  judging by the customer images on the sd600's page on amazon, i think i should've gone with cannon",1
"i purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a usb charging cradle that would not work.  this is terrible, terrible quality control and i will never trust another casio product.",0
"after discovering that the makers of a great camera would only offer such an inferior case, i did some more looking.  what i ended up with was a pelican case.  for those not familiar with these cases stop by any camera/photo shop, and they most likely carry them.  they come in many sizes and are simply an airtight, waterproof high impact plastic case with very snug fitting latches.  the inside is solid soft foam that you &quot;pluck&quot; to fit what ever you want to store in the case.  i purchased the 1300 for my finepix 3800.  the case easily holds the camera, battery charger, mini tripod, and 3 xd cards.  they come in 4 or 5 colors, and can be used for almost anything you want to protect from damage",1
just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted. never used. returned it,1
"use less than 3 times, the touch screen doesn't work.don't know why~",1
"i was completely fooled.  twice.  my fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for christmas.  so as i slowly open the box, i see a pair of socks on top.  there was more underneath, so i start opening it further and there is a camera case, a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box, the hp photosmart m525 digital camera!  i was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own.  no more borrowing from my sister when i needed to snap a few pictures.  i put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures.  to put it bluntly, ugh!!!  the first thing that i noticed is that, even in best picture mode, the pictures were a little blurry/grainy even in the best of lighting conditions.  the second thing that i noticed is that the pictures are distorted.  there's a slight fisheye effect (imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door.) which is quite annoying.  i talked to hp support (someone who spoke very poor english i might add.  what is the deal with that?) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model.  guess what?  same problem!  so after talking to hp once again, i am returning this one and getting a different brand.  this is a horrible product. my sisters kodak that i bought 3 years ago is a far superior product.  i am very disappointed.  hp needs to put out a better product, and have some customer support reps that speak better english.  it gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood",1
"the camera is a great camera.it is one of the best kind of camera in its level.everything is great in that(perfect picture and easy to work) but in that package as i saw in amazon add, the remote suppose to be in the package and comes with it but it won't and there is not remute in that package and it is kind of cheating...be careful about this product if you think whatever has written comes with package but not.",1
"as an owner of the sony dcr-hc30 model dv handicam, i want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line.  design and feature-wise, these handicams are great.  the problem is, they are built like junk.from the day i opened my box, i got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  in retrospect, i should have returned it for a replacement then and there.  but being a basically optimistic guy, i decided it just got dirty in transit, and i got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads.  it worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in sony's crappy labor warranty.  and from that point forward, i have gotten dirty head messages constantly, which at first could be `cleaned away,' but now, even when the message is gone, problems persist.i often get bars across the screen during playback, and i have already determined that i have lost many a precious memory of my infant children.  sony's solution to this situation is their standard ""flat rate"" repair program, truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what i paid for the camera in the first place.and sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared? they are just another electronics brand now, and one with sub-par quality and service at that.  guess i'll be buying samsungs or canons next time around.are you listening, sony?",1
"there is currently a known issue with many of the sony camcorders.  this is being called the ""black screen of death"".what happens is that the camera works great for 1-2 years then the ccd goes out like a light.  the camera will not take video again.sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support.  the fact is sony does not stand behind their product.  if this happens to you, sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars.there is a lengthy thread on cnet on this issue.  search for sony black screen.wishing you luck in the purchase of your (not sony) video camera,scot",1

"i have had this camera for about a year.  it has been nothing but a problem.  first, the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems.  i have spent hours trying to fix it.  still has bugs in it no matter what i do. secondly, the camera is very unreliable.  i have a wedding to go to this weekend and i do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too.  how do i explain the problems i have had?  there are so many.  the camera misfunctions continuously.  sometimes it does nothing at all.  other times the zoom lense will not shut.  you turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option.  i sometimes can not even shut the camera off i gotta take the batteries out to do so...if i can even find batteries that work in the camera.honestly, i call tech supoport and told them the problems i have having and they tell me that only kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some.  so i went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries.  the camera salesman told me that kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter.  i believe him.  so my camera which would not work...i asked the salesman to help me out.  it did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable. he popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked.  well, everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life.  my camera now does not work with either batteries.  probably only kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me.i personally don't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good.  really, when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed.  i am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know i gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera.  trying to save money on this 'disposable' camera was a waste.  stay away from kodak cameras!  if you don't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews.",1
"i bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock.  money thrown away!!  the camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk, also in my opinion. it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it, i threw it on the floor and smashed it.  not kidding! when i first got it,i called kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer.  we reset it and it worked for awhile.  then it wouldn't work any more and i did away with it.  no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked",1
"we never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new.  and one day, the lens just won't open.  it lights up then after a few seconds, it turns off automatically.  called a up a kodak service center and they gave me a quote for repair.the price they've given me is close to my purchase price here in amazon!i'll never buy a kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs.  i do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point.  so i'm expecting a believable quote for repairs.i think kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera",1
i'm giving this a 2 stars only because my daughter also had this camera onher wish list. if not i would of been upset having recieved the wrong camerathat i ordered.........,0
"i made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely. the lens is for a variety of canon cameras but the adapter only works with the a6xx series. my adapter arrived and it doesn't work with my camera. kinda misleading and now i have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately. bummer.also, captain jack is correct about the vignetting. this lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens. if you zoom wide angle, you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned. if you stay zoomed in, it works ok. disappointing",0
"i bought this lens for my canon powershot g5, and because it requires the use of a long adapter, not only does it cause terrible vignetting (that circle the other poster thought was cool, but which is actually a design flaw) unless you zoom most of the way, it blocks the built-in flash. i have owned four canon cameras over the past 15 years, and the g5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment. (i would have bought the digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses, but it didn't allow flash exposure compensation (insane for a $1000 camera body).)i do not recommend this lens or any of the g-series digital cameras from canon. when i've got the money i'll be buying the latest digital rebel and upgrading some of my old eos lenses, and selling my entire powershot kit. if you are an experienced photographer, you will not like this system at all",0

"i don't know what case others got, some have said ""too tight"" but mine was very loose. the camera is swimming around in the case, easily half a centimeter of clearance. not recommended. just buy the battery and wait for someone to make a good aftermarket case.",1
"rated one star for the lack of value. you can buy the same canon brand case for under $14 and a higher capacity, imho better, albeit non name brand, 1200mah battery for under $10 from amazon.  the neck strap is not worth the difference.",1
"i feel that it is just way too much money for what you get. i own a lot of professional (canon) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there. but it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price.i have the s80. no complaint there. the leather case was just way too tight, which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera. the flap issue is an issue. the neck chain is a bit short, and similar and better items can be had for a lower price. if you shop around you can also find the li battery for less.i'm not upset, but just disappointed with what i got for the price",0
"this was my second camcorder- after a canon that lasted 2 years but developed motor noise. this panasonic literally suddenly died after only 3 months ( well, 3 months and a week- thereby a week too late for the warranty and a ""too bad, so sad"" response from panasonic!). i had used it to film a wedding- it had terrible indoor quality and poor sound quality and obviously had a short pathetic lifespan. do not buy this camera",0
i have one and panasonic doesn't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests. the proprietary video format requires special handling in your pc and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips.  are they abandoning this product? look on the panasonic website and see for yourself,0
"while the everio will work on a mac, it is with jvc's movie program.  it is not imovie ready.  there is a very strange ""work around"" involving dvdrop that will make it work.  not very pleased with what i feel is misleading information about compatibility with mac",0
"i agree with the many other users who have experienced the ""condensation, operation paused"" defect on their jvc gr-xxxx. despite numerous others reporting this problem, jvc says its not a recognized problem. i would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs.",0
"i bought this to replace my broken digital8 sony camcorder and the same sales guy who sold me the sony 6 years ago advised me to buy this jvc, on one single criterion: the near-infinite hard disk drive storage. this was almost the only claim that was actually fulfilled.summary: infinite recording time, disappointing image quality and control for the price, painful editing. not for the average imovie user.positive points:- the storage capacity: a dream. i thought that 7 hours of high-quality video would barely last two weeks of vacation. actually it took me months to fill them. mostly because, as with digital cameras, you can throw away all the bad takes at will. i decided i'd keep all my previous good takes until i really would need the space, well... i still have my best clips from 5 months ago in the camcorder, which means that i can always show them at friends and family on location, even if i don't have my computer or dvd copies on me.- the size, weight and shape: perfect. you can take this camcorder anywhere without facing hard packing decisions. it's small, feels rather rugged. i added a wide-angle lens and the bigger optional battery, which makes the camera 50% bulkier but still manageable. the shape is great, at least for my hand size. i can really grab the camera properly in various situations of verticality and bumpiness... the microphones are not that well placed though, and i often cover them with my fingers.- image stabilization: very good. by chance i shot a clip with my wide-angle lens in the way, which gave me a good fixed reference to see how the beast is fast and smooth at correcting unwanted shakiness.- ease of connection: the usb2 link is ok. i'd have preferred firewire, but here we are not dealing with video streams but video files. btw, this allows faster-than-real-time transfer. a firewire link with the camcorder acting as a hard disk would have been great...ok points: user interface, reaction time (even if it takes a long time to get ready), optics, battery life (with the 3 hour batt. - actually a 1.5 hours).negative points :- image quality: considering the price, image quality is disappointing. frankly. the viewfinder is flattering but color saturation is in fact low, and clips shot on sunny days seem sadder than they are as i found out after shooting for a whole week in yucatan. clips shot on my digital camera (canon ixus 60)  look better. there is also a lack of control on image quality.- digital camera: simply forget it. my phone takes better pictures. i'd advise you to buy a 2mpix+ cellphone and enjoy the benefit of sending your pics and videos immediately to far-away family and pals.- file transfer and editing: pretty horrible with the originally supplied software. in marketing copy, mpeg2 files might seem nice as a target format, but we always have to edit our videos, and this is quite painful, whatever power-users might tell you. you are in for hours of conversion, except if you burn your raw takes, at the risk of boring your audience.i was going to write ""don't buy this if you are a mac user"". this is not imovie ready. i have both pcs and macs, it's equally painful and disappointing, except if you buy yourself a real video editing suite.still, if you have a mac and an everio get yourself the wonderful mpeg streamclip free utility from squared 5. it allows batch conversion of the everio .mod files into useable formats. you'll have to buy the mpeg2 component from apple first and change the .mod extensions to .mpg prior to conversions. time- and disk-space-consuming but worth it, as the image quality is superior to the one generated by the jvc-supplied software.neat thing: leave your computer at homethough you can't use the camcorder as an external hard disk (it is write-protected) you can copy the photographs from the sd card to the hard-disk, which means that with the everio, you wont need to bring your computer on a trip just to store the pictures from your digital camera.conclusion: given the choice, i won't buy this camcorder, mainly for the below-par image quality, as i'm ready to cope with the complications of conversion and editing. but i'd seriously miss the storage capacity",1
this is a good charger - quick and portable.  but the battery life of the battery sucks!,0

"this camcorder is terrible in just about every way:cons:- unacceptably blurry video; the specs say it records at 640x480, but it looks more like 320x240 (if that!) blown up to vga.- noticeable aura around any dark shape on a lighter background.- awful light sensitivity; forget about recording indoors--no matter how brightly the room is lit, faces will come out too dark.  the built-in led's don't help much (and not at all at distances over 4 feet from the subject).- noisy zoom that gets picked up loud and clear by the microphone.- zooming goes in irregular steps--completely useless while recording.- video lags noticeably behind camera movement; when image stabilization is turned on, the lag becomes so atrocious that you can't tell when to stop panning--utterly useless!- when using av-in and av-out cables, the firmware has frozen on me a couple of times; the only way to reset the camera was to remove the battery.- video encoding (through the av-in cable) produces an unacceptably noisy and undersaturated result.- the lcd display has a very narrow viewing angle; anything more than about 10% and you can't make out a thing.- still photos taken at the native 5mp resolution come out strangely grainy and uneven--something like a ""sharpen"" effect gone wrong.  i can get better looking pictures with my 2mp canon powershot a40 camera.- the manual recommends keeping the camera motionless for 2-3 seconds after snapping a picture (that's on top of the 3-4 seconds it takes the thing to focus before it snaps); but you can't keep the subject from moving, folks!  welcome to the psychedelic land of image trails...- flash photos come out with wildly different color balance depending on the color of the background.- the manual is a sorry affair--only 17 pages long and doesn't go much beyond identifying external controls and menu options.- i could go on and on, but i'll stop now, as you probably get the picture...pros:- the camera body seems sturdily built; the controls also have a sturdy feel to them, as do the battery and the usb port covers.  hmm... it's the only nice thing i can think to say about it.maybe a child (think pre-teen) could find this ""camcorder"" exciting as a toy, but i don't see how it can be enough even for an undemanding person looking to capture occasional life's moments on video",0
"poor focus, blurry, awful optics. don't waste your time with this one! can't compare to the little pure digital camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features.",0
the darn thing broke almost immediately.when i tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!what a flimsy piece of crap.i just sent it back to amazon. i'm never buying a jabra product again,0
"i bought this for $30 from best buy. what a waste of money!the ear gels are comfortable at first, but after an hour or so, your ear starts to really hurt from it.the sound quality is terrible! people i am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud, even on the lowest volume setting on my motorola v300.what is worse, people i am talking to hear me very poorly. they say there is so much background noise it sounds like i am in a noisy bar, even when i'm just sitting in my car. people can barely hear me over the background noise racket",0
"beware!  the ""product features"" for this product specifieda ""call answer and end button on the headset."" the device i received did not have that feature.  i selected this model because of the advertised feature.  amazon.com's description was erroneous and misleading.  i returned the item and was charged for the return shipping.  i emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product. they ignored my email.in the online return process, there's no option that states the return was a result of amazon.com's fault.  basically, they falsely advertise so that you buy the product, and when you discover it's not the right one you're screwed.  i now understand all those complaints i've read about amazon.com.  i'll take the loss this time, but i won't repeat my mistake and order from them again.  buyer beware!this review is not so much about the product as it is about amazon.com's false description of the product. i couldn't use the product so sorry i couldn't give a review about it",0
"i purchased this item for use while driving my car in oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  i was told it would work for the lg phones which is what i havei see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee i wonder why...i probable used this item a total of 8 times when i drove my manual transmission car, i didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.  the jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  while using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work.i emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  i have a feeling i lose anyways with this purchase.the thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for lg cell phones, iknow the one i got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch.to bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on ebay",1
junk. junk. junk.  mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working,0
i went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. people regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.',0
design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor - people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound/ mic is not clear or muffled. find an alternate hands free- piece,1
"i owned two of these earbooms. the fit was comfortable and the sound very good. however, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. i imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. the plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress",1
"i have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. however, i constantly get complaints from whoever i'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. i have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. the problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth",0
"the gel inserts on the jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  it's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  i'm not happy with these",0
"apparently you need to &quot;know&quot; your technical specs -- universal does not mean nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with nokia, i get the expense of sending it back. this should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site",1
"i owned samsung t809 months ago and i was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work. yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one.",0
"i purchased a brand new samsung t809, and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone.  i went to a genuine t-mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit.  the sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit.  clearly, a manufactuering defect by samsung.  i contacted samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that ""the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty.""  what?!  end result, i get to duct tape my battery in place.  thanks.  if you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product.  clearly not samsung",1
"i got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, i'm pretty disappointed with the phone. this is my first samsung and, i'm pretty sure, my last one! i owned a nokia before and i regret that i ""betrayed"" it. from now i wouldn't get anything besides nokia and in the worst case maybe sony-ericsson.so here is a short list of those ""little things"" that make your life, with this phone (and it's combination with t-mobile), annoying:- the keys are not comfortable to use.- it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time.- putting a comma, while writing a text message, capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot)- you can't set the camera shutter to be silent...- you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones...- you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address.and there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through, like it would've been in a nokia (even in a model 5 years old!)oh yeah, and t-mobile really ""contributed"" to the ""greatness"" of this phone, removing some of the features and limiting others, like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although, there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp",0
"i can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, samsung could produce this giant pos. it's flashy, yes. but does it deliver?? no. i actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. i loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and i even liked the video feature. but the phone is only good if you can use it!!! it's been years since i've had such lousy reception from a phone. i'm considering taking the dealer to court over this, since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. i want my money back!!",1
"has to be the worst phone i have ever had to pay for.  between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (i have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the wap when i have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  anyone who would charge some much for this pos really doesn't deserve my business",0
"going by the plantronics name i bought a pair of m60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone. they are incredibly cheaply made, and when my wife gave them a try she got a nasty feedback squeal several times during a long call. essentially unusable, unless we find some trick that we have missed so far. we ordered a sennheiser pc120 to try instead",0
"i bought 2 charges to try and save a buck, but they are complete junk.  they worked, but never well, for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit",0
"i agree with most of the others, it worked okay for a couple of months... now, not only does it not charge my phone, but if i plug it into my phone, it immediately loses all charge!  it's also always falling out of the lighter plug.  i don't have that problem with any of my other chargers and i carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets",1
"although this charger is suggested when purchasing the verizon razr, the phone complains that this an ""unauthorized charger"" and it will not charge the phone. do not waste your time with this",0
"does not work with verizon v3c. when i plug the phone in, it says ""unauthorized charger"" and refuses to charge at all. it is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a ""charger."" i give it one star only because amazon does not have the option for no stars. if i could, i would give it zero stars. i suppose that would be bad for business, but it is what it is. avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing. maybe it works in china, but not in north america",0
"a useless piece of junk.  worked for 3 minutes then broke.  have since bought a motorola-brand one for three times what i paid for this piece of junk.  do not be attracted by a cheap price tag, because you get what you pay for (or what you dont pay for in this case).",0
this razr car charger only worked for about 1 week then quit working.. i would not recommend this vendors products.,0
the premium vehicle power charger was not compatible.  i returned i,1
motorola one is far better in quality as well to use,1
"the product description should state that it does not work with the verizon v3c!  when plugged in, it states ""unauthorized charger"" and will not charge at all (although, if the battery is dead, it will give you enough juice to speak, but it still won't charge(?)).",0
"these are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from.  i sent mine back",0
"i bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  i had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but i lost one.  within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  if you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - i believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking",0
the service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. at the end i couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice,1
"save your money.  the eargels split in two days.  i used regular ear buds on the large size.  they did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality.  if you want the small and med, i'll send them to you for shipping.  i have no use for them",1
"i have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and i don't mean cost!).  there was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  and without fail, every single one i tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  every one!  it didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  the material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.i am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  i seriously do not recommend these to anyone",1
"as others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  you have to open the phone.  stupid design.  it does not have any exterior lights, such as my old samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  this phone needs to be opened to get any info.  can't even see the time without opening phone.while talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  i don't like that either.  it's also very hard to hear on it.  especially if in car, with traffic noise.  no, i'm not driving, but i'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  forget it.re the color that someone mentioned.  cingular is a light pastel pink, tmobile is magenta (dark pink).  the one thing i like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  i just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  oh, it must tmobile to get international service.  the phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but i don't use them.  i want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets.i would never buy this phone again, and as soon as i'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  i doubt i would get a  motorola ever again, i'll stick to samsung.",0
"i actually went through three of these phones.  each one that i had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call i mean the phone shuts off! then i would try and start it again, no go! so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and i would start the entire process over again. i complained so much to tmobile that they exchanged it for a motorola v360 which has all the same features, except better reception and an mp3 player.  i wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. my husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his",0
"i was so excited to get my first ""cool"" phone. . .i've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when i saw the pink razr, i knew i wanted one.  i saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.i have only had this phone for a month, but i am horribly disappointed.  it has horrible reception (and i know it's not the network because i tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls.  it also turns itself off all the time - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever.  i went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new samsung, but i'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations.  :",0
"t-mobile has the worst customer services. sometimes, it is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. since i started my plan, i had a problem reciving my bill on time. so, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. also, when i tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and i was charged for 10 cents for each message i used in these two days,and it costed me an additional $4. every time i tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. i am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. more than once, if i stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. i feeling that i am being treated like dirt not like a customer. i had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. also, the reception is not the best in the country. i had friends who were using the same phone as the one i have but different network, and they were getting services in places where i don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money",0

"i actually went through three of these phones.  each one that i had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call i mean the phone shuts off! then i would try and start it again, no go! so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and i would start the entire process over again. i complained so much to tmobile that they exchanged it for a motorola v360 which has all the same features, except better reception and an mp3 player.  i wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. my husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his",0
"i was so excited to get my first ""cool"" phone. . .i've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when i saw the pink razr, i knew i wanted one.  i saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.i have only had this phone for a month, but i am horribly disappointed.  it has horrible reception (and i know it's not the network because i tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls.  it also turns itself off all the time - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever.  i went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new samsung, but i'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations.  :",0
"t-mobile has the worst customer services. sometimes, it is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. since i started my plan, i had a problem reciving my bill on time. so, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. also, when i tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and i was charged for 10 cents for each message i used in these two days,and it costed me an additional $4. every time i tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. i am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. more than once, if i stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. i feeling that i am being treated like dirt not like a customer. i had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. also, the reception is not the best in the country. i had friends who were using the same phone as the one i have but different network, and they were getting services in places where i don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money",0
"the product itself would have worked great if they included all the pieces. only the plug in portion came, no usb cord.  i then requested a cord and webtreo said they would mail one to me immediately, but none came.  i emailed their customer service again and have received no response.  fyi - it works to charge your ipod too",1
this case does not work well. the case blocks the camera eye and the clip lasted one week,0
"whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its poor design. the attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. the plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. the problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. the pocket stretches! as soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! you have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. this is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. use this glove at your own peril",0
"looks nice, protects the i860 very well.  but... i've only had it for 3 months, the release broke off after 2 months which i rarely used.  the swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets.  the cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera, it has to be held down away from the lense.  body glove needs to send this one back to the engineers",1
i never got my order even after a month after i placed it.  they reply to you email with false info.  always saying its on the way.  one item that i did get was the wrong item.  you have been warned. be very careful from these guys.,0
"i've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers, but found i rarely used the number of minutes i was paying for.  a prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go, and sti mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire.  i signed up and shortly after received my samsung phone.  it arrived, however, defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged.  per the sti mobile web site, i contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone.  this resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service.  in the first one, the rep told me that i was mistaken, and must have been sent the wrong charger.  no offer was made to replace the charger, strangely, which was included as part of the package deal.  after additional emails where i reassured her that i did in fact have the right charger (i took the phone in to a local merchant, who showed me the charger i was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective).  at this point, the rep apologized and told me i would have to contact samsung for a replacement phone!  this entire process took several weeks.in short, i guess you get what you pay for.  if i had been shipped a working phone sti mobile probably would have met my needs, but i was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider",0
worthless. it rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off. flimsy and broke within a week. not even worth the 0.01 i paid for it which is sad. :,0
poorly made and weak. pulls the battery off my razr everytime i disconnect it from the holder. stopped using it within a day after purchase. there are better holsters for the razr on the market. avoid this one,0
title says it all.  phone falls out.  clip swivels badly.  justtrash,0
"my motorola c139 with net10 crashed on me.  i called net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone, except they sent me this flip phone (v171).  i liked my candy bar phone and didn't want this flip piece of junk.  i was happy with net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing, and then things quickly went downhill.  net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone, even though i had minutes available on the old phone.  i gave my wife the v171 to use and took back from her our cingular phone, which works awesome with no problems.  she had problems all the time with the v171.  she had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed, even the local numbers.  she also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send.  in my opinion, the v171 is completely worthless.overall, i am a very dissatisfied customer.  my recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service.  go shop cingular for all the great deals they have",0
"service is terrible, no good ringtones, my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates. dont get it! you will end up paying the same if you have a plan",0
i wouldn't recommend this product to any one. the phone cover really sucks. i just used this product for a month....and the clip cover peeled off....really disappointed with this purchase.,0
"i agree on ""it was too good to be true"" statement for this package.the material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap !. the charger melted in the car after a sunny day, i couldn't even test it. earphone quality is not good as well, giving a constant humming noise. the case is the best out of these three so far. so one out of three for 10 bucks. i am not recommending anyone to buy this item.",1
"the case and ear bud are fine, but the car charger i was sent doesn't even fit my nokia 6230. that was the main reason i bought this package.",0
"this deal was too good to be true. of course i wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least i expected them to all work. i don't know if i got a bad earbud or what, but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used.the case i didn't need, but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed. the power adapter seems to work fine. so basically i spent $9.99 and am only using the power adapter. i guess that's a good enough deal. i think i'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud/headset though",1
"i recently purchased this bluetooth scala-500 and used it all about maybe 5 times.  why such a short amount of time?  because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that i am told it sounds like i am in a windy tunnel when in fact i am in the car with the windows up and radio off.  it's a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on  the other end can hear me.  now i keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my logitech bluetooth is out of power.  if you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere.  the only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone.  think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first.  even with the rebate i only paid $[...], but still not a bargain.  the one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone",1
"as soon as i bought it i realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. few days later my concerns proved them selves, every time i made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. every time i was lucky to realize as soon as i droped it, untill today when after coming home from shoping i realized my z520a is no longer with me. there goes a $200 phone, lost because of a stupid $10 holster.  do not buy this product, if you realy need a holster go with something like sonyericsson's ""ice-26"" that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. as for me i gatta get me a new phone, shame i had the z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and i really liked it",0
"the skin is a great idea, but it is not practical.  it is too thick to work with the seidio cradle i have, so i must pull off the skin to sync my treo.  the skin buttons do not always line up with the treo buttons, so i misfire applications.  the holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time i pull the phone off the holster.  do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly",1
"i was looking forward to the speck rubberized cover with some excitement, however i was disappointed.  while the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment, after the first day it looks like it's two years old.  if you have an sd card in your treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily.  and the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt.  don't even think about putting the treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket.  finally, the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover.  if you're in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover, but for the rest of us...keep shopping or buy insurance",1
"the skintight cover is cool. works pretty well with the unit, but the belt clip sucks! it's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa.",1
"the headset really has bad sound quality.  i missed the reviews before i ordered & i shouldn't have bought it.  considering the quality of the headset, i didn't even try the car charger in the fear that it wouldn't follow the necessary battery charge cycle",0
this stuff isn't even worth $14.99.  my husband and my aunt couldn't even hear me.  it's a piece of crap. i sent it back the same day.  don't buy it!!,0
"please, please please do not buy this phone!!!  i have had this phone for 6 months, and i am so disappointed!  of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then i began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  i took it to the local sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  that worked for a few weeks, but just recently i've started having the same problem.  i just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not my phone--i had to use my work time) with sprint and sanyo.  of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now i have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  so please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone",0
"i was with sprint for almost 10 years, all told. i had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. just recently, without any warning, whatsoever, they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time.  most of these pics were very important to me and are now lost forever.(i had only backed up about 45 of them.) i guess it was my own fault for trusting sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when i tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had no record of me ever having the picture account that i had with them for almost three years!!! this is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! so, my advice: don't trust sprint!!! again, this happened with any warning! it could happen to you too! trust me: avoid sprint at all costs! i should have",0
"i got this as a gift, its too thin for me. i""m not into the credit card sized phones.  picture quality sucks, its hard to manage it.  the menu buttons are inconviently placed, such as the my content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling.  its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone!",1
"i bought this item to protect my new motorola l6. first of all, it's a cheap piece of plastic... would break if dropped.second, and more important, my phone doesn't work with it on! the plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone, preventing any usage of the entire phone. beware... don't buy",1
it looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily. the shipping was fast and the price was right,1
"i tried to cancel the order, but they said it has been shipped.  i was cancelling on october 13, 2006, but the package labeled that it was shipped on october 17, 2006. how can it be shipped 4 days after it was shipped",0
you get what you pay for.  don't bother with this at all.my car charger did not work at.  see other reviews on the problems w/ the leather case.  save your money,1
"i haven't tried the hands-free device and probably won't bother, but the case is cheap looking and the charger didn't work at all.  as they say, you get what you pay for!  i'm going to an actual store and get a real motorola accessory kit.  don't bother with this one",1
"i read the other review about these falling out of the reviewer's ear...  i figured at this price, i'd try for my wife and i.  when i first tried them on, i instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on.  even with the provided clip, these fall out and you're better off not using them.  frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones.  two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive.",0
"samsung has a great phone with the black jack.  unfortunately, the headset jack is not a standard jack, but instead one unique to samsung phones.  therefore, you are forced to buy samsung's headset.  bottom line -- don't bother.  the design is horrible.  the earbuds don't stay in the ear.  what makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord.  any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear.  i hope that samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones.",0
"i think this is the worst nokia phone i have ever had.  it just doesn't seem like it's nokia quality to me.  i would get the samsung slider if i could do it all over again.  battery life is subpar, slider seems cheap and breakable, speakerphone is not loud enough.  the interface is pretty smooth, but that's about it.  if you have to have a simple interface, then this might work, but otherwise i'd get the samsung",0
"i got this phone cause i thought it would be a nice little phone. wrong. yes it plays songs. yes it is little. too little!!!! this phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers. the voice dialing does not work! it is hard to use. i returned the phone after only 2 days! i got the samsung t629. totally better. does almost everything the nokia does, but is better, looks better performs much better. if you are a teenager this phone may be good for you. the samsung even sounds better. get the samsung, same price more phone",1
"it was broken in a few days of use, you should buy a hard cover instea",0
this headset is not compatible with the nokia e62!  the nokia e62 has a 2.5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory.,1
"for $4 it's not bad, but within two weeks the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic, looks horrible, but if you don't care how the case looks then this is the case for you",0
"snaps on easy but snaps off easy too.  it also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do.  this case also hinders comunications, maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line",1
this thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you don't ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo,0
"i got this for cyber monday for $20 too.  i thought i couldn't go wrong for $20.  well, i was wrong--it was twenty dollars completely wasted.  i'd feel bad giving this pos away...  i could not get the thing to stay put, the boom mike is so bottom-heavy that it won't stay close to my cheek even sitting still!  and it pokes out about 3 feet to the side of my head (it seems like it anyway) if i am moving around at all!  almost like it was designed to get as far away from my voice as possible.  but even holding the stupid thing with my hand did not help the sound quality.  i got constant complaints that i could not be heard very well.there are only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating.  first, i did only pay $20 for it.  second, it's a decent quality, just piss-poor design.  and three, i liked that when i clicked the button (not due to incoming call), it automatically launched the voice dial menu, so i could really make a call without ever touching my cell phone.  i guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfr for both headset and phone. but it fails miserably at it's primary design goal, so i heartily recommend staying away from this product",0
"saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece, so i took it.  the installation was a little tricky at first, but once i got it paired with an lg chocolate, it was functional.  tested it out all over the house, and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet.  used it driving, and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels.  not a quality bluetooth earpiece.  look to motorola or jabra for a decent one",0
"this product alone does none of the things listed in the descrption by itself. you must still buy other software to use it. when i questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says ""may require 3rd party software for various uses"". i just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was all uses we have listed. i would rate my experience with this seller as: dissapointingat least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere.",0
"i know from experience. i have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years. i think one company makes them all. they will not last. the cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out. for some reason, it only happens with the palm-type cables. my ipod and usb retractable cables have lasted. perhaps one just ends up using the palm device cables more for hot-synching and/or charging daily.see my palm page at [...",1
"i bought this cable. my first peeve was that it was shorter than the original palm hotsync cable, but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place, so watch out, and treat this cable nicely. i like the retracting cable concept, but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged",1
"function followed form on this one!! you can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. so you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. it hurts your ear when talking. the buttons are difficult to push. it's my third motorola and the prompts are different than others...motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. too many prompts to reply to a text. thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. i returned it and got my money back",0
"this holster offer's your phone zero protection.  not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster.  while it does allow the phone to swivel, thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated, i ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead.not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement.all in all, i would not recommend this holster.  i'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak..",0
"while this is a functional holster, be aware that you may -- like me - find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster.  i know, i know.  you can turn off the ""answer phone when opened"" option, but that is not preferred by everyone.you may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely.",1
i chose virgin mobile thinking they would be a good company. i have never been treated so rudely by customer service people in my life. in multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people i never got the same answer twice. it was a nightmare.i ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money. i feel stolen from.i would never do business with this company again. huge mistake in the first place,0
"i'm writing a review for the first time because i've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. i bought cell phone cases from world of bags so that i could give them as christmas gifts. i ordered them on december 5th. it took them until december 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! it was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] needless to say, i did not get to give them away as christmas gifts. this is the type of service i got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(i can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! they also shipped them seperately. a sign of inefficiecy, indeed. one came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. i've decided to not return the items because i want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again",0
"great concept: protective rubber skin that protects the blackberry unit from accidental drops and scratches.  the rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint.  it's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off).  the protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well.  mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if i try and reposition the unit itself).  the plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged.  all in all, i am pretty disappointed... mainly because i paid over $33 for it.  it's now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust",1
"my husband and i found these cases for our new slvrs and were excited.  unfortunatly, like others, we have found that they don't fit our phones.  we have the right style slvr, the case just doesn't fit",1
i purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr l7.  it doesn't fit.  the case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone.  don't waste your money.,1
"this phone case is the worse one ever for the treo 650. yea the color is great but, if you just tap it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit ease.  the screen protector is not that great either.  a piece of plastic over the screen.... you have to lift it up so now you have a piece of 2 cent plastic over a five hundred dollar phone.  not smart.  now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screen to protect it. quote ""it attaches easily and i especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed)."" well about this statement. insurance!!! if you invest in a five hundred dollar phone then you must have insurance on it.  so, i guess you are not hosed in the end.  final:  i am very disappointed in the cover and recommend that you invest in another product (leather).  i bought this item hoping to have something different.  the sale price is really what it is worth.  six bucks....  $6.00 on a $500.00 phone.... my bad.. i really should have tough about this one and this is a warning to others.  how cheesy... i tough i was getting a deal",1
"i bought three of these at once - and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3.5mm headset for listening to music, but they didn't handle calls at all - everything is full of static, listening and talking. i just placed a call with it, and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible, but it was the adapter that was the problem, full of static and echo. i would never use these for calls",0
"i enjoyed using this phone for some time.  it was functional, it felt solid, and it had a nice low profile look. however, after around a year and a half, the continued act of opening and closing the phone has caused the hinge to crack, and to gradually break off completely.  i now have to hold the phone together with my hand while i talk, which is extremely awkward.  this is especially frustrating given the rest of the phone is so well made.  furthermore, it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my ""upgrade"" opportunity (in a couple of months), and right after my purchase of some extra accessories (batteries/chargers).  search around online for ""a670 hinge"" and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine.  this in itself wouldn't be a problem if samsung would willingly replace the phone.  however, they are not claiming it as a design defect, and neither samsung nor verizon are offering to replace it.  bad form for both, although perhaps verizon isn't as much to blame.i would avoid both samsung and this phone because of this incident.  this phone is seemingly designed to be durable, but it frankly is not meant for the long haul, and is too pricey given its average performance.",0
"samsung a670 is a lame phone. also, the battery life is not good. it didn't have many features so its just a waste of your money. the ringtone volume was too low. i would suggest samsung improved this phone. i am not sure if i ever want another samusung again. i have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust.",0
"this battery is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670. when you put it in, it reads ""bad battery"" on the screen and will go no further",0
"i don't know about other company, but accessory export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture.  i bought a genuine contour leather case for motorola razr v3, but what i got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic.  there is no leather on the case at all. not only that, the cover smells like petroleum oil",1
"this is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of your phone. the outside is a faux leather, made of plastic that looks convincing enough. all told it is an acceptable choice, trendy",1
"this worked for only a couple days. although the belt/pocket clip held my treo securely, it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way. after a cople of days, the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time...after a couple more days it was useless.save your money on this one..",1
"i've owned a tracfone for 3 years.  my old tracfone quit working, so i purchased a new one.  i've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new tracfone.  it's been a nightmare-after 4 weeks, 3 new sim cards, and countless calls to tracfone customer service reps, i've accomplished nothing.  my phone is still not activated, i still don't have my old number transfered, and i've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps.  i don't recommend tracfone",0
"got it home put in the sim card, add the battery and changed the phone. once it was charged i went to activate the phone, it said ""insert sim"". i redid several times, called support, got the run around, becaused it did not understand my error. when i got a person, she said the same thing, after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card, the lady said they would have to send me a new phone, mind was broke. so we will see if the new one is better, next week when it comes",1
"we've had 3 of the lg1500 in our family plan for nearly a year.  very inconsistent service.  when calling our son, i would get a message that his number was ""blacklisted"".  after calling cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not lg1500.  we were told it was ""like for like"" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand.  if a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!",1
"i got the phone because it was small but i didn't know i'd be sacrificing so much. the speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day. i get shoddy service and while i do like the design, there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and i can see thru to the casing. all in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies, but it's not really the best for what you'll want to do with your cell phone.",1
"i paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards. the phone will say ""insert sim card"" even if it is inside. it recyles, and when it does so, the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped. there is a very minimal selection of graphics, ringtones, and games.  you cannot change the mini display. save your money because you might end up spending 40-50 bucks on sim cards, and another 50 for a replacement phone.",1
"my wife and i got two of these phones for ""free"" when she switched to cingular. after two weeks, we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly. my phone was fine, but has lately been experiencing the same issues. i know service is not the problem as i had a samsung phone through cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas. sometimes i'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back.i do not recommend this phone. even though it is/was free, it's not worth the frustration",1
"i got this phone in january, and i had to take it back the day i got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls.  they gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone... but it wasn't.  the one i have now isn't as bad as the first one, but it still loses service and drops calls constantly.  don't buy this phone",1
"this has to be the worst phone i've ever owned.  i thought motorola startac (my very first phone) was bad, wait till use this phone.  i have 4 lg c1500 phones in my family plan.  2 works ok but the other two, where do i begin.  first, it keeps complaining to insert sim card although it's inserted properly.  went to cingular store got the new sim card, works ok for a day.  next day, same thing.  did this 3 times and had cingular send me the replacement phones.  now one of the two doesn't complain about the sim card but occationally it says it's not in the network although it shows full bars.  the other one still have problem with sim card.  i just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but can't talk more than a minute.  it just drops a call in the middle of conversation.  i now am trying to get a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it.  i am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to go, what a nightmare...",0
"we bought 2 phones on a family plan last october.  we were looking for a very basic flip phone capability, no bells and whistles needed.  our major use was to communicate between each other.  we were happy for for about 5 months.  since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned.  our phones were replaced during april. one sim card was replaced during june. yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone.  another replacement phone is on the way to us.  the major problems have included ""service not available"" even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location, ""unable to read"", ""insert card"", and of course dropped calls.  yesterday as i was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call.  at this point i have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution.  i can not depend on it.  i would not recommend it to anyone",0
good case...functional charger...*headset not compatible with the nokia 1100!!!* completely different connector type...look closely at the product photo,1
"totally impractical - this model smartphone is already fairly bulky - this just makes it as lot more so.  even worse, you cannot attach it to your belt or pocket because there are no clips and /or loops in the design !",0
"the construction is shoddy, very bad quality leather, made in china.my phone (cingular 8525) would not even fit in it.the design itself seemed awkward.it went straight back to the boxwave",0
"the usb cable and software did not work for the sony z525a phone, purchased through xcingular. the phone will not connect to the pc. the phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable. uninstalled the software and tried again, with firewall shut off. same result. connecting a usb device should not be this difficult.",0
"i bought this case to protect the best bar phone on the market, the sony ericsson w810i. within 2 days the case already started to crack and chip. i dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case. the case also scratches easily too. the only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish, but i have a feeling that i am going to have to replace it pretty soon. bottom line: this case only protects against scratches.i was actually looking at the clear silicone cases",1
my car adapter lasted for about a week and then it broke and my case riped on the 2 day,0
unless you have a cd with a program that is specific to your phone this cable.,1
"first: the part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws.  second:  no fixed belt clip.  third: only the case is black, all other parts are clear plastic.  bought 10 of them for 36 cents each, spent 35 dollars on shipping.  guess i got what i paid for.  now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund",0
"when i first got this item i was very pleased. it was so cheap and it looked great. it snaps so easily on and feels really cool. however, after about 3 weeks, the duller, not so shiny coat that i liked on the cover started to come off. beneath it was a very shiny black coat. i was so disappointed, i took it off and went with my original cover. it looks really bad and just looks like something i've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks. i am very displeased with this item",1
"i have a ux245.  as you can tell from the item name, this product should have been compatible with my phone.  however, when installing the cd, you are asked to pick your phone from the list.  my phone wasn't even on the list.  then i got a message saying it woulrd corrupt my computer if i continued to download.  however--who wants to send it back for a refund when you lose shipping and the shipping was as much as the item!!!!!!!",0
"do not order from this company. the cable does not fit in the phone. unfortunately, i did not read the reviews before purchasing from eforcity. the cable came a few days late. when it arrived, the cable did not even fit. the software for the cable was defective. after it had finished installing, windows xp came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system. eforcity is awful",0
the only support i received was to send me to a competitor's homepage and try to download their software.,1
"the cable worked. that's about it. the software provided did not work, and it did not include the vx8300 model?! there was no contact information for the manufacturer, and i spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate driver, plus i had to find software to use this thing",0
"usb jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in (it works now, but has to be held in by hand).  came with no instructions, and, if you don't have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers, you won't be able to figure this out.  the driver cd is useless more or less, since they don't send you a ""product number,"" which is needed to access the menu on the cd.it works, and i am able to send files to and from my phone, but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer, and a whole lot of cursing. i won't be ordering anything from them again, and if i had it to do over, i'd order the cable from a different company",0
"i was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own.  the cable itself is o.k. but i had to locate the correct drivers on my own and it's definitely not intuitive, and definitely not plug-and-play.  support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitor's website to locate the drivers on my own.  also, (and with no offense intended) if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you",0
"it took a week and half to receive it - 3 days to get confirmation for the order only, and they ship by regular mail;then there's a single protective screen pre-cut in a plastic, it doesn't cover well the whole screen surface (it's about 1-2 mm narrower) and it's very tough, hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath, i had to take it off immediately, then once removed from place it's a waste",0
"i bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable, i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics, even though it is more its worth it",1
"this cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting.  i do not recomend it.  it costs more to ship it back then it does to replace it.  i will chalk this up to ""you get what you pay for""..",0
"the case fit well, but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart. i'm very gentle with my phone, but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one. it no longer stays on so i threw it away. the bottom is still on great, but it dosn't do me any good without a top!",1
"i ordered a three-piece set of an earpiece, phone cover, and car charger for my motorola i860 phone. when i get the order, the phone cover, custom supposedly, was too small for my phone. my earpiece worked temporarily, then it started shocking me, now it doesn't work. the only piece, the one i didn't need, that worked was the car charger. i'm very unsatisfied",0
"net10 cell phones are great, but don't buy this card.  net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards.  i put the pin # in my phone and did not receive the minutes.  i called technical support and received 1000 minutes.  i was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that i will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days.  don't buy this card",1
i put the multi-clip on my belt and the spring metal bent out of shape. i found another clip from another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also. the case is great but the accessories suck. poorly made with light weight materals. save your money,1
"this clip came with the case that i bought for my palm treo phone. the second day that i had the case i lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasn't able to be fixed. i am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner. i would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around at a desk. i don't know if it was just my clip, or if all of them are made poorly.",0
"function followed form on this one!! you can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. so you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. it hurts your ear when talking. the buttons are difficult to push. it's my third motorola and the prompts are different than others...motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. too many prompts to reply to a text. thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. i returned it and got my money back",0
"excellent high-res lcd, but the rest of the phone was a disappointment. poor overall interface with configuration options in non-intuitive locations. particularly disappointing was how it handled wifi. each application seemed to want to be tied to a particular wireless source. so, i'd go home and try to get it on the wireless, but i'd have to bring up the app, let it spin a while, be told it couldn't connect, then i'd have to tell it to use the local wifi. it was just clunky. the poor utility of things like wifi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone, and a very expensive an bulky one at that.i can check and respond to email far faster on my blackberry than i could get this thing to get an appication running and connected via wifi. much better wifi management is a must before i'd consider this phone.this is a serious example of one device trying to do everything, and doing nothing very well. the device is relatively nice, but i gave it two stars because a $500 price tag means it has to deliver. i bought and quickly returned the phone",0
"i wouldn't buy this unless it's an emergency, because it's one of those chargers that reports errors, and makes your phone start beeping non-stop when it's done charging.  i don't want this because i like charging at night, the other chargers don't do this (i guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall, like switching off, when the battery is fully charged..so it beeps as if it's being plugged in over and over).when i first got it, i was trying to carefully plug it into my phone--and i didn't want to damage the little metal things inside my phone or on the charger.  it wasn't going in smoothly and it didn't match up or seem to fit inside at all.  so i went a day without a phone and i did more research to see why the heck they'd lie that it fit my phone.  finally i got fed up because i couldn't find another charger anywhere where i live and i tried forcing it.finally it fit!  but i had to shove it in.. who knows if it was damaging my phone.  but it was charging so i was happy (my cell is my only phone.. so i was cut off from the world).  then i tried getting it out and couldn't figure it out!  i had to jimmy it off, and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secure itself.  i was able to put it back on, and finally learned a routine so to speak, for taking it off, but it's cheap.  it's very cheap.so, the charger works, but it's very hard to use and it isn't convenient at all.  i don't recommend it unless it's an emergency.  for me, it was",0
"this adapter was supposed to charge ww600i as listed , but it did not even fit it . its totally false information being given for this item ..will never purpchase it from this merchant ever ..cant belive amazon has these untrustworthy merchants",0
"i guess you get what you pay for. this charger works, but apparently not quite the way sony ericsson would like it to. when using this charger, my se w300i often reports charging errors. this never happened with the original se charger (which my dog ate, hence the new one)",1
"a very basic phone with not one good ringtone, display or wallpaper.  did not recieve the usb cable. i am going back to the nokia 6102i.",0
"i had to return this phone twice to motorola for keys that weren't working.  it was too frustrating.can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior nokia worked well. there are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual.--customisation of the front screen is do-able.--there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  no mention in the user manual.  stumbled across it.--ringtones are expensive to buy from cingular.  first you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  a double payment.  the saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.  --the volume was always frustrating.  i was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  volume controls are easy.  however putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.  -- i especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  you're being responsible and the phone does that annoying moto noise.  it's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume",1
"i must live on the edge of cingular's (and everyone  else's) coverage area.  this phone can't hold a call at my house, and i have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength.  part of the problem is the coverage area, but part is the phone, too.  i have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem.  if you live like i do in a pothole on the information superhighway, avoid this phone.",0
"i'm on my 3rd v-180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it (under warranty) for another.  unfortunately, they have the option of sending you a refurbished model, which means that they tried to fix someone else's problem phone and pawn it off on you. this one is going to get flushed as soon as i find another phone to buy, since cingular says it's now out of warranty and i'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months",0
i had to change 4 phones in one year with cingular. not worth its mone,0
"i gave this one star because there is not an option for zero stars.problems:general:        1.  sim card does not store the full information on each          contact and is therefore useless.phone specific:        1. sim card failed after less than 1 month and had to be replaced.        2. foolish designer attached vibrator module to flat cable connecting base piece to hinged piece.  the vibration causes the cable to delaminate and soon the vibrate doesnt work and eventually the screens fail and you have to order replacement phone.          3. less contact fuctionality of any of my previous phones ie. multiple number entries.        4. one of my 3 phones (in a 8 month span) failed after a fall of 10"" onto the floor. yes 10"" ... less than a foot.        5. i have to disassemble the phone and clean the microphone every month or so or no one can hear me talking.",0
"we were excited to find such a good deal. the clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse. the home charger never worked. the car charger works, so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package. one thing my boyfriend and i learned through this experience, is to pay for known quality and performance, in the long run you save money, hassle and time",1
"for a good price of approximate $4.50 (as i recall) plus shipping, i ordered the bargaincell- brand new ikross retractable car cigarette lighter adapter.   it did not work.   i suppose i could have packaged it up and sent it back (at a cost to me) and probably received a replacement. but for the cost of the unit, it was not worth my time. i've resorted to using a standard car recharger",0
i bought this usb cable for cingular my lg cu500 but doesn't work with it. strongly i don't recommend this others.,0
"this product does not work!!!!!! it is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer, i wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer.  no way!the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it.  i have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work.  i dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is.  the disk has 40+ files on it, i dont know if one of the other drivers would work, but i am very frustrated",0
"i bought this battery to replace the original one that came with my cell phone.  the ""new"" one holds a charge a shorter time than the old one does!  i have to charge it every day, whether i use it or not.  i feel ripped off, to tell you the truth",1
i only buy it because i must to have a battery backup for long trips and i can't wait for the seidios battery,1
"well the only good thing one can say about the treo 680 battery is that it's thinner. the battery for the treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day. as the treo 680 battery only lasts a 4-5 hours under business use, the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are: deplorable, distressing, lamentable, unsatisfactory and unsuitable. i'm really dissapointed that palm delivered such as lousy battery with the treo 680. but happily, there is a quick fix, buy 1-2 more batteries and keep them charged and don't leave home without them ;-",1
"unlike the other review, i can not recommend this at all.  the gps regularly takes at least 10 minutes to find satellites (sometime longer), the palm needs to be resynced (bluetooth) with the gps at least once a month.  when it does work, its great though",1
"i purchased this to replace a lost holster.  the first time i tried to place the 7290 in the case, it split at the seams",0
"the battery was not accepted by my motoraola phone.  it was a ""pirate"" product and worthless.  unfortunately, i discovered it after the expiration of the amazon return date",0
"i bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge (after sitting in a closet for a year). i was thrilled to get a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again. i opened it up, put it in my phone, tried to close the battery cover and it would not close. not even close. if i forced it really hard i could get it to just close over the latch, but it was actually bending the plastic of the phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment.the battery is about 50% thicker than the standard battery for a motorola v60. might be great for the extra battery life, but bad if you can't get get the battery cover on your phone. i give it two stars because the battery may work fine for all i know, but it won't fit in a v60",0
the case looks horizonal... but a belt clip is placed vertically making it obtursive and cumbersom,1
"although it's listed under the accessories section for the v66, it is not for the v66.  well, i guess it will work with just the phone, but not the extra battery.  no sense in having this if it doesn't charge the second battery.  i checked it out on the motorola site, and in fact, it is the wrong one.  this charger is the motorola spn5029, which doesn't work with the v66 and 2nd battery.  the correct number is the spn4970",0
"hi,before buying this phone from amazon, i called palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new. i subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and i am using it on the t-mobile network.i now have a problem on the display within 2 months of purchase. i call palm and after multiple run arounds with tech support, they asked me to read out my serial number. it starts with a haga which, they indicate, means that it has to be on the at&t wireless network. according to them, i am in violation of the warranty since i am using it on the t-mobile network. how am i know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my purchase? if i am purchasing a gsm unlocked phone, obviously i need the flexibility to move to a different network.palm is taking the easy way out - they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from amazon. amazon, itself, does not provide any warranty.if any of you have had better luck with palm or have any suggestions - please let me know.thank",1
the price is high considering that there are newer models.,1
"this was the second treo 600 that i got from amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working. when i contacted palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then i called t-mobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset. still didn't work. i called back on satuday 02/04/2006, palm told me that i have to send them the unit for repaire or pay $25 to get a ""premium exchange option"" and that i would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day. i called back on the following wednesday palm said to wait untill friday.called on friday they said that it could be shipped on monday. i asked to be refunded my $25 because they lied on the terms, the operator said that she could not",0
"guys,do not take this sheet piece for god sake. i am repenting on it :( please take my advice. thanks",1
"i purchased a treo 600 when it first came out. that phone was so bad that like an idiot i upgraded to a treo 650. i was on cingular with both phones. onwing this phone and being with cingular has been the most painful customer experience i have ever had. i'll spare you the details since they've been documented well elsewhere. i will add that after my 4th phone dying on me, i decided to cancel my service with cingular, which renders my locked phone a $400 paperweight. i've gone over to verizon and to a samsung phone running the windows os. palm was a good company once, now they have got their heads up their #&(&^$#(. makes you wonder why the treo 700 is running windows now???",0

"i bought this for my lg mint chocolate vx8500.  when you go to install the driver, you're supposed to select your phone from the list.  well, it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete, and my phone wasn't on there, which probably means that yours won't be either.  don't waste your time on this cable and just buy the music essentials kit that is actually made for this phone",1
the product arrived fine and on time from accessoryone.  but the cable would not stay connected in the usb port on my computer.  i had to hold it just right for the cable to stay connected.  i threw this cable away and wound up buying verizon's music essentials kit for my lg vx8600.  the music essentials kit provided a cable and driver that work fine,1
i took a chance and it didnt work for me.  i have a lg vx-8600. had to return the product...good luck to you,1
"thanks god that the phone can survive a moderate fall.  the case pops open very easily and despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case, its all loose after that.  another disappointment, the circular 'knob' that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing, again you guessed it, falls.",1
"advantages:1) superior protection: i have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case.2) all buttons accessible, though a bit difficult to get to in cases.disadvantages:1) signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case!  2) belt clip useless, since the case can easily open, spilling out the phone when on one's belt.  3) side ""ok"" button difficult to press, same with top two front front buttons (above ""start"" and ""ok"" buttons).summary: usable only for protection during transportation, and does this well.phone should be removed from case during usage",0
"when i recieved this item, i had mixed emotions for the product. on one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the qwerty keyboard.however, due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials, the case is very thick and bulky - when using the belt clip, the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip, but leans at an angle.but, the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times i have dropped my cingular 8525 (which at such a steep price, is not something i like to drop). the problem lies with the snap-shut system that closes the case. because the metal is so thin, it does not secure very well, and can come open pretty easily. to fix this, i simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone, so that it was much harder to both open and close the case. this, for the most part, solves the problem, but it is still dangerous and caution is definately in order.my favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case. this is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages. this is the only reason i did not give it a one-star rating. i am currently looking for a soft case, preferably a leather sleeve case that i can just pull my phone out of off of my hip, rather than bother with a clip anymore.as a final warning - be careful if you buy this case. plus, i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point",1
"let me count the ways this thing let me down:1. you have to open it to slide out the full keyboard, making it vulnerable to damage2. it doesn't matter whether you open the case or not. if it drops, the case falls right open anyway, spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protect the 8525 from.3. the case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it.4. the case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something, and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged (at least that's what happened to me).super disappointed in this product, in case you couldn't tell",0
same comments on the latch opening easily. my complaint about the belt clip - it is made of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use. wouldn't buy again,0
"please please dont buy this just by seeing the photos.it looks nice and great but practically this is a piece of junk1.it makes buttons more deep down there by making inaccessible.2.the stylus grove is not good there by making stylus to project out and it will slip3.the flip is improper.i mean who on earth would do such a lousy design.it opened and my fone hit the ground thrice and i cingular does'nt insure this instrument.4.the screw.one of the worst part.it cannot sustain the weight of the total phone with the case.why the hell is screw for?6.once i hook up this fone to the belt i don't want that my fone would twist and turn 7.and the worst of all,when the flip faces downwards,which happens by twist and turns,the flip opens and cell fone hits ground wowowwww such a nice design to a piece of junk and hats off to the lousy designer and i hate my self for buying thisif you love yourself dont buy thi",0
the latch is pitiful.  the phone fits nicely but that latch is not secure.  with in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customer's house.  tons of fun watching your $500 pda hit the ground and the battery come flying out.phone is ok but the case is getting replaced asap!!do not get this case!,1
"originally, i purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525.  however, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up.  luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but i have several big dents and scratches on the case.  i'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up.the latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use, especially since you'll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen.  also, it took a bit getting used to, to have to open the case to make a phone call.the overall quality of this case is very good tho, because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons.i guess its a great case if you don't wear it on your belt.  but i can't justify such a huge case if i carry it in my pocket.",1
"i dropped my treo enough times to break it, and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case",0
"i have a lg vx5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with, was a no go. product would not install from enclosed cd; computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosed usd cord. a loss of time and money. i have since ordered, received and installed from another product - data point from another vendor",0
"maybe it's because this product is not approved for windows, but i couldn't get it to install",0
"yes, the cable fits, but the cd driver is just for the 8300. i was not able to get it working",1
"the cover doesn't fit snug with the phone, the stitching broke after two weeks, and the release button is triggered from the bottom.  it also falls off from the clip.today it fell off in a parking lot, when i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car.this is a poor quality product and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone",0
"i've had a silicone case on my treo 650 for a long time.  it was thin and the rubber was very grippy (great anti-slip)- once i left my treo on top of my car (not recommended) and drove 10 miles, and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when i arrived!    after it finally broke i ordered this one to replace it.   the rubber on the boxwave case is much thicker than my original case, so much so that it's difficult to use the 5-way navigator without it doing what i didn't want it to do.  the case is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat, unlike the original.  boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive- since this isn't, i probably won't bother. but in my opinion, there's better products out there",1
"these cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in asia. with that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped. the software being aftermarket too, has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone. despite what the descriptions say, this software and cable are not compatable with mac at this time",0
"i ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life.  after about 1-2 months of use, the thing shorted out and wouldn't work any more.  i decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured i'd give it another chance...  the thing didn't even work out of the box this time.  i only wish i could give it zero stars...  spend the money on a motorola brand charger instead.",1
"when i started charging my k750i, it didnt charge at all no matter what. this is a load of s***. dont buy i",0
"i bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the sony ericsson z500a (this model is listed in the description).  first off, the cd that comes with the data cable does not have my phone model on it, making it useless.  i figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from sony ericsson's website.  after downloading the software and following the instructions to a tee, i was still unable to link up my computer with my phone.  i even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case i made an error.  all told, this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with amazon",0
"chargers work great and are a great bargain.  however, the generic ""lg"" driver software that comes with the usb cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesn't have an authenticity signature.  i don't know about other computers, but mine with windows xp (sp2) won't accept it",1
"prior to buying this phone i had heard a lot of people say that motorola's hardware was very good, but that their software left a lot to be desired.  nonetheless i decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan.  i had made the decision to switch to t-mobile and this looked like one of the best phone options.  right off the bat i found out that the people who criticized moto's software were right on the money.  there are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone, not the least of which is the -- frankly -- idiotic way the phone book is designed.  eventually i made peace with all of the things i disliked about the v360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone.  as time went by i started noticing that i was missing a lot of calls.  the phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that i had received anywhere from minutes to hours before.  during the course of the last few months (the phone is less than a year old) i've also found that it has begun crashing.  a lot.  opening or closing it will result in a ""white screen of death.""  putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging, that it is unable to charge and that it's sim card cannot be found, after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off.  with a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off.  at this point i am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece of junk.  i am also forced to conclude that it isn't the only model which is.  none of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a motorola phone.  my wife's motorola has shown its own host of problems.  people working for t-mobile at several stores i have visited have confided that they never, ever recommend motorola phones to anyone.  in fact i've had t-mobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them, but rather to shop for an unlocked nokia online.  so that's what i'm going to do.  until i can buy a new phone all i can do is recharge this phone every night, restart it five or six times a day, and keep apologizing to my friends, family and employers for always missing their calls",0
"the sound is low, static-ky, and it frequently dropped calls. boo.",0
"i got the hs805 to call home while trucking. i was sold on the aaa battery power source, because the rechargeable ones won't last on a 14 hour work shift and even then i have no 120v outlet to recharge.however, i have to say the audio output when adjusted to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler at highway speeds. the wind and engine noise is much higher than in a car and similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft. for this reason alone, this headset is junk. the advertisements criminally overstate the talk and standby time as well. with a regular new duracell aaa battery, i get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby. and with a 900mah duracell rechargeable battery i get only 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone. as for the marketing department at motorolla, i have to say great job for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated function and durability. i hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people. hint: get a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecing society. you should be proud!",1
"don't waste your money. after 18+ months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life. instead of updating to a newer phone, accompanied by a new 2-year service agreement, i opted to purchase a ""new"" battery. waste of money! the new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means i must re-charge nightly. that was the same predicament i encountered with the original battery - nightly re-charge.",1
"this battery was no better then the old battery it replaced.  when phone was new, battery life was good. not sure what is the problem.  maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use. vendor service was good. or maybe just a bad battery.",0
the headphone has a standard 8mm plug and won't work with the katana. the case is absolutely worthless. don't waste your money on this product,0
the software that comes with this is not the right software for the vx8500,1
havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it. not too sure how it works...its not showing my phone on any of the software programs (after i hook it up using the usb cable),0

"i was extremly disappointed when i received this. it did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can. i had one of the first razor phones and it did not fit. when i got th belt clip i went to cingular to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip... that didn't fit either. i would no recommend this product to anyone, even if it does cost a dollar... with shipping cost it costs about $6.00",0
the case broke the very next day that i got it,0
you will still need to buy the ac cord for this unit.  this is not a charger.  it's essentially a $30.00 piece of plastic that holds the q upright.,1
i bought this product about a month or two ago. and i still haven't been able to figure out how to use it. i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use. this product seems  to be a lot harder unless it's the wrong data cable which it shouldn't be since it's advertised as an env data cable,0
"the first problem i encountered with this came right after i took it out of the box.both connectors were covered by labels, which left a bunch of sticky residue when i tried to pull them off.  i spent about an hour just trying to get them clean enough to use.second problem came when i popped in the ""software"" disc.  it turned out to be nothing more than a readme file linking me to drivers that didn't even work.  i spent another 20-30 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked.the cable itself worked fine after i managed to clean the connectors off, find the appropriate drivers, and download windows media player.  be aware, if you have a chocolate with v5 firmware, you won't be able to use programs like bitpim with this cable",1
do not buy this item!!!!!!!!!! i havent even dropped my phone or hit it against anything and its cracking on all corners.......,1
"i received this item and the blue illuminated cap is not present on this item.  there is a less expensive product in the marketplace w/ a mere blue led that looks similar, and that product costs about $10 less @ best buy.  while certainly this product works satisfactorily and the price is decent, you should realize that what you're going to get is not what is pictured... unless eforcity fixes things, that is",1
bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died one week after their return/replacement deadline.  shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month??  they refuse to refund or replace.  they are a shady company and i'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same,0
"i've had car chargers before, for other cell phones, and never experienced any problems. i was attracted to this one by the low cost, but i guess you get what you pay for. it lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether.",1
"the charger i got did not fit the motorola v188, wrong connecter. i was offered a full refund",0
"this product is not what its cracked up be, if looking for a screen protector, look elsewhere.  i can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad.  waste of $10 and customer service won't respond to my email, matter of fact, email to customer service didn't ever deliver",0
the product broke the first day i used it. i'm going to have to be more careful. i think they are all cheep.,0
"bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. refused to refund or replace even though the product is clearly defective. this company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. consider yourself warned",0
"this is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen. i attempted 4 times, washing the back thoroughly between each attempt, cleaning the cingular screen with a new lens cloth. once specks of dust touch the adhesive they're there for good and the protector is ruined. i gave up because i was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than i was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid! save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in.",1
"i have had to exchange my pink verizon motorola razr 3 times!!!!!!  luckily i purchased the insurance....  i'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr (this last phone only lasted a few weeks!)... this time i am asking for different phone.  the phone works fine then all of sudden one day, 1/2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the ""#"" is on the screen and you can't get to anything.... no phone numbers, no voicemail, no text messages, nothing!!!! it is extremely frustrating.  what is the point of a cute phone that doesn't work",0
"i hate this phone.  i moved to miami and cannot get reception anywhere. it  cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk.  i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment, so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates.  but here's the thing:  other people on verizon using a different brand phone like lg have absolutely no problem!  they actually get a couple bars of reception, whereas i always have one or none at all.  i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it... with all the same problems.  i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month.  i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price.  on top of that, people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous.  unless you never talk on it, the battery wears out in a hurry.  and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking.  i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident.  i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils.. chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one, or wasting money on a land line.  whatever you do, don't get suckered in by it's cute pink color, because underneath it's pretty exterior it's junk",0
"i'm not a huge fan of this phone.  i got it because i needed a new phone, it was only 40 bucks and, it's pink.  1.  the battery life on this phone is terrible.  t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e.  yesterday, after charging the phone the entire night, took it off the charger about 8am for work.  i made a 5 minute phone call, a 6 minute phone call, entered a number into my contacts, entered an event into my calendar, received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping ""low battery""!!!!!2. the ringtones are sooooooo crappy.  remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago?  that's what is here.3. the date and time don't continuously display on the outside screen.  i don't have a clock in my office (i have a very small office and work for a non-profit) and i don't wear a watch, i'm constantly opening my phone to see the time, it's ridiculous.4.  the battery life is terrible.the good thing about this phone so far:great reception.  i hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes i am able to speak to them before the battery goes dead.  if you want a cute-sy phone and you speak for less than 10 minutes a day, this is a great phone.  otherwise get something else",0
"after my nextel phone started acting up, i decided to switch services because i liked the razr style and a lot of people i was calling were already on verizon so the ""in"" calling was a bonus. i have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my motorola i860. you can import only a couple of mp3s before the phones memory is full, unless you buy their $50 transflash card (1 gig is the largest). then, you cannot assign the mp3s you import as ringtones either, a major disappointment for me - again missing my i860 with its 400+ ringtones that i imported from random wav, midi and mp3 files. you cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events (you have to set a reminder for all, there is no option for no reminder). all in all, not what i grew accustomed to with my i860.  i'm already thinking the $175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what i will spend over the life of my 2-year contract. and that leads me to another rip-off with verizon, they charge you an extra $35 to sign only a one-year term! next time i'll read the fine print, and just upgrade my nextel",0
"well im 16 [writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account] and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink, but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it. first off, it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen, and that takes forever, the phone in general is slow. also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece. im stuck with this phone for a while, and am not to happy with it",0
i am terribly disappointed with my razr v3c phone.  i purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the only positive features.  the viewing screen is so small that i can't even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size.   the battery dies about three hours after being charged even if i haven't used the phone.  it does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has verizon service.  i am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and i can't find any way change this.  i wish i had my old sprint phone again.,0
"holds the phone well for a few months untils the clips on the side loosen and break.  after that happens, the phone falls out pretty easily. (and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working)  i ended up replacing it with a different holster from rim that has a magnetic clasp.  (the replcement works great",1
"this is a very basic holster, and often simple is best - but not this time. the good news: the 8700 slips right in and out with ease, the swivel works great, and the clip is reasonably secure. a minor issue, becuase its plastic, when the virbrate ""ring"" is active, it makes an annoying rattle sound. the real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs (one on each side). everyday use must weaken the plastic, becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case, which meant that they 8700 would not stay put. it slipped out and fell to the floor several times. i replaced the case, and a month later, the tabs on the new case broke too. due to cheap build quality, i'd suggest you look at third-party case options instead of this one.",1
i recived a blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case i tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did i tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic. the reason i gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call. i suggest you get a leather on they work alot better,1
"i have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months.  it used to be only $6 each so it didnt matter too much (nextel sells theirs for usually $15-$20).  this is a cheap knockoff.  but if you are looking for a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replace them, feel free to buy this item.  now that they have raised the price to $10, i'll probably not buy this anymore and get the better one at nextel",1
"ahhh i see your battery is dying.  be forewarned.  i'm betting this doesn't fix the problem.  i mean really how old is your phone?  not old enough yet to have made this battery tired.  the li-ion batteries usually last around 18 months (hence at 18mon a bunch of i-pod users are gonna get pissy when the i-pod doesn't work anymore and you can't change the battery.)why hasn't yours lasted that long... oh because your phone sucks.  you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 hr on standby at first and then drop down to 4 hr on standby.why?  have you noticed yet how hot that phone is running?  it is cooking its internal electronics, your ear, and the battery.when you get a new phone - the new one will only have a 90day warranty.  t-mobile will charge you for shipping.  you will spend at least an hour with them on the phone.aren't these costs adding up for you yet",0
"i have to return this.  order motorola, not some off-name brand.  it doen not fit the phone it says it fits",0
"just as a note to any motorola i530 users, this belt clip does not fit the phone.  the wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove.  do not bother with it.  this item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another motorola phone, but i have no way to find out as i only own an i530",0

"i purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone.  my old battery would not hold a charge anymore, so i wanted a new one.  the new one proved to be just as bad.  i don't think it's a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead.  would not recommend ordering this if you're looking to replace an old one",0
"i ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters. i got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind, not at all like the ones shown. the shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so i am not going to pay to send them back. i never got an e-mail about the substituation or response to my calls or e-mail to the company. i will not buy any thing else from them",1
"the other reviewer couldn't run much power through his splitter, but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers, etc.i wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger, so i thought great.i can't get any power through mine at all. the little light goes on, but the radar detector doesn't go and the cell phone charger doesn't go. i'll probably take it apart andd see if i can rewire it. it isn't worth shipping back.i really can't recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer",0
"there's nothing &quot;universal&quot; about this product.  it'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones, but don't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter.  i hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second.  sadly, i'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself, and all four died when i tried them with my laptop.  the back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps, which seemed reasonable, so i got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most, so not only is this busted, but they lie on the package.  i managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse, and then it worked for a short time until i started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one of the springs inside couldn't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it.  i give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously.  for anything else, beware",0
"i have had three of these during my two year contract, i am trying to baby the last one enough until the end of the two years.  each has had the problem of powering down and re-booting without warning.  the are billed as ""mil-spec"" this or that, but unless you keep it inside a purse, get ready for many trips to the sprint store.  motorola used to be the name in communications, but after this and my friend's problems with the razr's, i'm headed to nokia",0
"my office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract.  no person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance.  battery life is terrible out of the box, the interface is clunky, and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance.  if everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you-- it will give you something to complain about.  for the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your nextel/sprint network contract",0
i have a business acount with 8 lines.three of my phones are the i530s. i have had nothing but problems with these phones. i have had one repaired three times. each time i went to repair it i had to be  on a  waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model. i would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later. now i am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging. i keep spending the $35 charge for swapping them. and nextel customer service is a joke. they will not admit these phones are pieces of crap. when i call i wait for an eternity througha  million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before i reach them.,1
"stay away from this phone.  the 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired. picking up my last i530. if this one goes, im canceling my nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier. i've had it! nextel and motorola can't figure out that this phone is junk",0
"my problems with nextel did not stop when i canceled my service. i will get to the problems with the service. when i went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, i of course wanted to keep my number. so as i went to get my cingular phone (highly recommended), i had the old number switched to my new number. today, i get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though i had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. this was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. in my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. in the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. i constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. most of the time i would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. not only would i not get the calls, but often i would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. when i did actually take calls (and call out), i cannot count the number of times i've had my call dropped. i recieved so many different error messages sometimes i wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. that brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. this is an absolute joke. direct connect only works maybe half the time i tried to use it. even then, in the middle of the conversation i would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me i wont be talking to that person anymore. of course, i would expect nothing less from the nextel network. text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. if it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. the internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. i was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. my experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and i write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. stick with verizon or cingular and you will be much happier in the end. don't make the same mistake i did.",0
"my wife and i both got this phone at the same time.  i chose it because it claims to be rugged, and the price was right.  well, we have had them for around six months, and they are both not working right.  my wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case, so her i560 now wears pink.  shortly after, it started resetting itself randomly.  she would pick it up, just to find that she needed to enter the sim password.  over time it started doing it more and more.  at first i believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change, but later my phone started doing the same thing.  now, my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day.  i absolutely cannot believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect.  anybody can ship one bad product, but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable.  shame on motorola",0
"i purchased 2 i560 phones - one for me and one for my husband.  brand new out of the box, 1 of them had a bad microphone (you could hear the person talking, but they couldn't hear you).  nextel & motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days - but i raised a stink and finally got it replaced (since it was broke from day 1, i didn't want a ""serviced"" phone).here we are 3 months later, 1 of the phones has a bad microphone - again, and the other phone's keypad just went bad.  we don't mistreat these phones at all - in fact, we hardly ever use them!  motorolla & nextel's warranty is also worthless - we have to pay to ship our phone's to motorolla, and we don't get them back for 15 days!i am stuck with a 2 year contract with nextel, the service has been horrible, and the i560 phones are lemons & junk!  i would never buy a i560 phone again, or use nextel - their service is terrible!  and yes, many times the person on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking (aka - drunk)",0
"i bought this phone at the same time i bought the i870. i've dropped my i870 a couple of times and it's fine. my husband dropped the ""rugged"" phone once and the antenna, which sticks out like a thumb, snapped off. nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan, regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards. what army? do not buy this phone! (unless of course, you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months",1
"purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530, which i loved. i was at the end of a 2 year contract, and felt that i would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons.  two of my family members have higher end nextels and all work well. i would have purchased one of those, except i didn't really care about a camera for my phone, and this one was reasonably priced...and i found out you get what you pay for!  the i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750, i870 and even my old i530.  i had it for a couple of weeks when i started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - i could hear them, but they couldn't hear me.  a couple of times, i had the screen go to airplane mode, even when i hadn't touched it.  the fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside, too.  my previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling, but i had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it.  not a great design for this holster. another problem is with the power supply. when charging the phone, it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly. then i am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working.  living in california apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee.  fortunately, we were on day 12, and after 54 minutes, one accidental disconnection by nextel and 6 customer service agents, i finally received a return authorization and placed a new order.  terrible, terrible phone.  stay away from it.  hoping the new one on it's way works much better!michell",0
"i got this phone as part of a buy-one-get one free promotion. i changed from cingular because i couldn't stand my bill being constantly wrong. the i560 seemed like a good choice at first. however, it is not as resilient as advertised. within the first two months, my phone already malfunctioned. while talking to my wife on the phone, the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen. next, all i could hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key. i was not even touching the phone. the phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off. once i removed the battery and placed it back into the phone, the phone restarted and went directly into airplane mode. this is the most annyoing features of this phone and i wish you could disable it altogether. my wife's phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone. mine is currently on its way to motorola to be repaired. caveat emptor!",1
"i was seconds away from ordering this charger for my mother's v170.  thanks for the reviews - you have saved me time, money & frustration for letting me know - it won't work",1
"i would have thought that amazon would have fix the problem that it did not fit v170. i ordered and guess what, it did not fit. i am returning it6/6/0",0
"i bought my wife a brand-new v170 for her birthday.  she wanted an extra charger to take to work so i bought this one.  big mistake!  it simply would not fit in the charger jack.  so basically, it's a worthless piece of plastic.  last night when my wife was cleaning the counter, she threw it in the trash, brand-new box and all.  at $7.99 it wasn't even worth the trouble to try to return it.  don't make the same mistake i did",0
"i saw the other review that said it didn't work for v173, but i bought this anyway for my v170.  it also doesn't work for v170.  why amazon is advertising and selling this product as a motorola v170 charger is beyond me.  i guess sometimes the products are mislabeled.",1
the jack doesn't fit in the hole of the phone on the motorola v173. don't know about v170/,0
"first the pros: clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screen, protecting them from wear. fit is tight so the case takes up little additional space in my pocket.now cons: dirt and debris easily finds its way between the plastic and the phone. this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone. the plastic screen also attracts dust. when i tried to remove the phone for cleaning, the side of the case ripped.all in all, i would not have bought this product again. please avoid",1
"i wanted to give it only one star but maybe it's a little better than the original...but i can't really tell much difference.  it still goes down by the end of the day and i don't like the bulge. oh well, it's only $15. it was worth a chance...",1
"my equipment is a nokia 6225, i have 2 pc with windows 2000 professional (sp4) and windows xp pro and both don't works . they don't know the device, and with the pc suite of nokia it is not connected either.who can help me ?thanks",1
"i assumed that i would get a dku-5, which is supposed to work according to the nokia site.   however, i got a dku-2, which does indeed connect to my phone (6016i) but is recognized by neither win xp nor linux.i'm bummed...  the part number should have been properly displayed somewhere.  the packaging indicates that it is in fact nokia part",0
"if you are buying this to connect to a nokia phone beware.  it is a non-nokia part and will no easily interface with the nokia software.  it uses a different chipset than the nokia data interface cable, which prevents it from using the standard nokia drivers.  you may be able to get it working, but i have spent about four hours and have not met with success.  i installed the drivers provided.  i installed nokia's drivers.  i even installed the pl-2303 serial driver, but i could not make it work.  also note that this cable is a serial interface.  if converts the usb connection to your computer into a serial port, so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed.i would recommend against this purchase.  spend the extra money and buy the real thing.  you'll save yourself some head aches and heart aches.god bless you",1
the cord does connect to my phone but the computer does not register the phone. this cord is pure crap,0
"although this product is very nice, i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. to me the words ""charge all at once"" means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. however, this is not the case. this item is simply a method for organizing you devices. although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 i paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, i would return it. i feel that by using the words, ""charge all at once"" they are purposely misleading the customer.",1
"i was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved treo 650, and did so last january by upgrading to the treo 680. i have been a faithful customer of palm technology since 1997, and for the first time, i am disappointed. of course, i still have the friendly palm os, tailor made for smart phones. i also have upgrade compatibility for my 15,000 records stored in the treo's four main applications. but the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail versamail sync and phone conversations, and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands (contrary to the 650, buttons are too close to each other). reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired, especially compared with the 650 after firmware update. finally, i use intellisync for dual sync with both user-friendly palm desktop and heavy duty email ms outlook; the acquisition of pumatech by nokia results in a clumsy new release of intellisync for treo: intellisync new version added a record number in the ""note"" field of all my records ! i quickly reverted to an older intellisync version and i wonder what will happen when i need to upgrade with  ms office 2007 compatibility... nokia's low blow to palm ? it is time palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own. if not, it's decided: i will switch to the pearl",1
"the good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the treo 650's interface that were clunky, and it seems to crash less, but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience -- so much so, that i wish i had never ""upgraded"" to the 680.",1
"i 'upgraded' to this phone recently from a treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems (don't all treo 650's suffer from that within a year's usage?) and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems. i loved my treo 650 anyway so i expected something equivalent to the 650 but what i got was a 'smartphone' with quite a stupid battery life.  i have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design (some online geeks suggest it might actually be the sim card) that is causing power to run right out of the phone, in a sharp decline, even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled. add to this the fact that palm's website's online user group is not active right now (so no users can visibly discuss this among themselves),and you don't have to think too long to conclude that palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward, when they recently dumped this cheaper ""smartphone"" on the market recently.  palm, all i can say is pretty ""stupid"" and wonder if this was your last hurrah before exiting the ""smartphone"" market?",1
"i've used the palm os going on 10 years now.  when my treo 270 died, i bought a used 270 on ebay.  eventually that one died too and i bought an unlocked 650 on amazon.  i called palm ""tech support"" on issues i had with it (dial up networking didn't work on internal browser with t-mobile).  forgive me for saying it, but the guy at palm support was as dumb as dumb can be.  i got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another (he insisted that my treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -even though i told him first hand that i used it all the time- did he think i was lying to him?).   he knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor, constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time.  after a few calls like this with no resolution i gave up and decided to return the 650.i then tried the t-mobile mda.  i was uneasy of the idea of switching to windows pocketpc but decided to give it a try.  for me it was a huge mistake-  pocket pc is a joke and completely unintuitive.  they expect you to study how to use their os in order to make use of its clumsy interface.  friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use, but c'mon- when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning- i don't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly.finally, i give up on pocket pc (sold it on ebay) and give palm another try when i see the 680 come out.  the dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 (as compared to the 650) and i buy it unlocked directly from palm.  overall, it's a decent phone and i just feel way more comfortable with palm os over pocket pc.  palm customer support is still useless and, as others have mentioned, the lack of a standard mini-usb connector is simply inexcusable.  still, i'm much happier with palm-os over pocket pc.as i use it, i see that the battery doesn't seem to last very long (just over 2 hours of talktime at the most).  i hesitantly call palm support and get some flunkie again-  i decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their ""support"".  i'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged.  i hate the idea of making such a compromise, but for me it's the lesser of two evils.  the fact that palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset.  they just don't care.   as clunky as my windows mda was, its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the treo gives me (even though the mda has a much bigger screen).imho the smartphone market is still going through growing pains-  the original handspring treo was designed by good people, when palm bought them out they cashed in on the treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the treo.  most of the better designed smartphones on the market (samsung, motorola, htc wizard) are all made for pocket pc because microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market.  i just wish other manufacturers offered palm-os based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of palm, without having to be limited to palm's poorly designed hardware.....maybe it's time i finally give the blackberry a try.... :",0
i love the way the phone looks and feels but that's about it.  from finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone i've ever owned.  i've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise.,1
"first, let me say that i really wanted to like this device. i had patience and understanding for a while but it got me nowhere.the main issue with this phone is its operating system: windows mobile 5.0.this os is a piece of fluff garbage. simple things that should take a click or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just give up.main gripes-----------connectivity with t-mobile is horrible: accessing the aim function doesn't work 9 times out of 10. e-mail functions are useless. i tried finding a solution for hours and the best i got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that. internet explorer can never find the page that i'm looking for and consistently tells me to try again. even when connected to wi-fi this happens. let me tell you also that this device does not let you choose between wi-fi and edge. if you already opened ie and you were using edge then it will continue to use edge unless you restart the phone with wi-fi enabled.calls-----making a call was so difficult that i wanted to smash the phone on a daily basis. usually, i would press talk to dial a call and it would immediately say ""call ended."" it's as if the device doesn't even want to try.also, when answering a call, well trying to answer a call, it would drop it as soon as i pressed talk. what the hell is that!? what good is a phone if you can't make or receive calls? keep in mind this happens around half the time. also keep in mind that i live in new york city! my calls should not be dropping except for when i'm in the subway. the side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation. not only that, but when you disable it, you have no other method of changing the volume on the device. arggghhh!keyboard-------while the keyboard is basically easy to type on, the phone is buggy. first off, the t9 sucks! it will completely change the word you are typing to a word that's in its dictionary while you're typing! extremely frustrating! now get this, you can't even permanently keep the t9 off. so you have to keep going into the menu to change it to normal abc mode. while i appreciate the ability to have faster typing, isn't the whole point of a qwerty being able to type without using t9? when you actually get to typing, sometimes, the keys will ""stick"" and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it. this isn't a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue.programs-------for all you techno oriented people out there (basically everyone buying this phone), the programs this device has available for download are minuscule. not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a java program (which most programs are coded in) the dash's java program will not allow you to open those programs. i always get an error stating ""a java midlet is not responding"" it then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app. neither of which solve anything.this phone is so useless it's beyond words. i could go on and on about it's issues but i really don't care to.stay away from this phone!while t-mobile customer support is very helpful and friendly, their service/coverage is non-existent. calls are constantly dropped, i get voice mails without the phone even ringing, and internet connectivity is never really available.please, do yourself a favor and wait for the iphone.",0
"in summary, microsoft's software and t-mobile's service have ruined a brilliant design (although with a couple of flaws) from htc.there are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to.  i will break it down to hardware, software and cell phone service provider.hardware pro's:a lot has been written about this aspect of the device, so i'll keep this to a minimum - the best form factor i've ever seen.  this device provides you the power of a blackberry without the bulky hardware so i can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster.- a key selling point for me was the combined bluetooth, wi-fi and quad-band connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset, cruise web pages and have access to email when in the us or europe.- the phone quality is excellent.- the keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails.- the battery life is great when wi-fi is not enabled and adequate when it is. (i've rarely struggled with a dying battery.)  stand-by power management appears to be excellent.- charging of the device is very quick.- the display, while a little small, is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size.- the camera is pretty good and it's been really great emailing photo's to people as i'm traveling around.[after all of the cons that you'll read below you'll wonder why i ever bought the device and why i still use it.  well here it is:1. t-mobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device.2. it has great hardware that i can use in the us and europe, i'm just hoping that microsoft will finally get it right. ]hardware con's- the touch sensitive volume button is the most ill-conceived feature i've ever seen.  even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level.  even worse, when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control and randomly change the volume.- the ti omap 850 at 201mhz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device.  however, the blame could well be laid at microsoft's door for writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications.  either way, performance is very slow for some basic functions (see below) and i'm afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor.software pro's- not many that really come to mind.software con's (i hope you're sitting comfortably)- when a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and which call to put on hold or drop/ignore.  on the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is dropped/kept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed.  the other call is dropped and not put on hold.- when a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked, if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped.  this is extremely counter intuitive.  if the user presses anything other than the ""answer"" key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when i have depressed the ""answer"" key.- the contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used.  even worse, upon selection, the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open.  now, i have what some would call a large database of contacts, but considering that the palm os version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash.  it's simply a poorly architected database.- the user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary (as are all dialog windows on this device.)- one of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock.  the user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness.  the digital watch i had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged. first of all, the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off.  from the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm....if only it were that obvious.  the best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example: i set the alarm for 6am; the next day the alarm goes off at 6am.  that day i set the alarm for 7am - the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am.  the next day i set the alarm for 7:30am and you guessed it, the alarm now goes off three times.  the best that i've been able to deduce (of course, this type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device) is that the user has to actively select ""off"" for the current setting before setting ""on"" for the new time.  but there is no indication of what alarms are set, so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of what's set and what isn't....the only way to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard re-boot.- the calculator is a joke.  if this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired.  a calculator watch in the '80's had more sophisticated features.  the user interface is so bad it's hard to describe it in words. - microsoft truly does not understand how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that they've inflicted upon us since windows 95.  most features or function have to be navigated through the start menu button.  applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections.  some features are simply hard to find, but should it really take so many menu selections to find common tools or applications?- the use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous - to put the device in ""silent"" mode, but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up, for example, does not work.  calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property.  the only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events....otherwise you get an alarm at midnight.- so, on my nokia phone a thousand years ago, when i went to europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency i needed once landed.  the phone would then automatically connect to the provider available.  it wasn't completely automatic, but the user interaction was simple and intuitive.  not with the dash.  first of all t-mobile doesn't help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming.  the feature is free so why not add a selection anyway?  all you know when you get to your destination is that your phone won't connect to the local network no matter what you do.  now, assuming that you worked this out, you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local provider's network.  on my blackberry this was automatic, but of course with microsoft there are selections to make, searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice.  assuming that you get connected at all.- activesync: this is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work.  worse still, when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization.  it does not provide you with a fix, a hint or a path so that you don't lose data.  it does not even tell you the data that was lost.  so, i'm using a microsoft mobile os with microsoft xp and microsoft outlook and they can't get that right?  (ok, it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much microsoft, but come on.)  this was another primary purchasing driver for me.  i am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my pc and pda - all the time.  it's the only way to keep organized.  i thought that with the same provider of all the software i'd be ok.  also, as this feature has been around for over a decade from palm and perfected by blackberry....how hard can it be?there are probably annoying nits that i have with the software, but those are the major ones.  and they are major.considering this is windows mobile 5.0 what on earth were they doing for 1.0, 2.0, etc.?service provider pro- t-mobile is useful to me for traveling in europe.  they have much better coverage over there than in the us (where i'm actually paying).- their package is competitive.service provider con:- coverage is not good enough.  i'm in san francisco and i have dead spots in my house.- their back-end connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy.  at random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connection and emails can't be accessed.  but you know there's nothing wrong with your connection because you've been on the browser.  also, there was a whole day that emails were not accessible.  because of the many issues that i'd had with email set up and maintaining a connection i went through various debug routines wondering what had failed.  when i finally called technical support they told me that their service was down - no apology, no notification, no nothing.  certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience.  (so, why didn't i call technical support earlier?  read below...)- their technical support structure is terrible.  i have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their ""help"" line.  i'm not going to go into details as it would just take too long.  bottom line, if you have a problem with your phone say ""dash"" at the prompt and then ask for tier three data support.  everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians you'll encounter have inadequate training.  if you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial - do not do it - this cycles you back around to tier two data support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device.so, should you buy it?  wait until windows mobile 6.0 comes out at least.     maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time. then see what else is available",0
"my phone broke after a month or so.  after spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted to blame me (did you put it in fluorescent light, did you put it in the sun, did you drop it, did you put it in your pocket and bend it, did you put it in your pocket and bump into something, did you drop it, did you break it, did you do something bad to it) they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money.the most amusing part of the conversation went like this:  would you like ups ground which will take 10 days or ups 3 day which will cost $15?  when i responded that the ground would be fine she said ""ok, that will be $9.95"".  i had to laugh at their arrogance.",0
"due the lower price of the charge i decide to buy it, but it doesn't work on my sony ericson w300i at all, bad inversio",0
"este producto no es lo que anuncian,100 metros de alcance y solo palabras no sirve, no la debuelvo porque me sale mas caro el envio de lo que cuesta esta porqueri",0
the external antenna is a plastic decoration only and does not do anything functional.  false advertising,1
"poor construction, software that is difficult to install, unable to run when installed, and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy.  buy something else that actually works",0
"i encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. as soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.  the main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes.",1
"this item was an absolute waste of money and i'm all the more irritated for having purchased it.  upon attempting to merely insert the device, the outer case of the dongle split open.  what i discovered?  that cute little 'antenna' doesn't actually connect to anything!  it's just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side!when i finally managed to get the damn thing running (the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pair/connect a device) it worked fine - once.  i turned off my laptop, removed the dongle, and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all.do yourself a favor.  shell out the extra 15-20-30 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2.0 bluetooth usb adapter.  don't make this mistake",0
"i am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up.  instead, i cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plug-and-play",0
"the product works, but the software that claims to be windows compatible say's it is not when installing. caused a lot of annoying delays when installing. set system restore point before installing. software hasn't caused any problems yet.",1
"this is a terrible product. it is too big for your blackberry. they send it with another door for the backside because your current door won't fit over this huge battery!!it is frankly unbelievable that blackberry, and amazon, would foist this product on us.the battery is so big that the device will no longer fit into your blackberry holster.do not buy this idiotic product",0
this device is unusable with a treo 600.  every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card.  don't waste your money,1
label states that it is for a 600....it doesnt fit a 650 as well as i thought i,0
very simple--it is not fit the treo 650.  look elsewhere for a case or clip,0
the krzr is a really cool looking phone - but it has 2 huge issues - a very short battery life (1 day) and sllloooowwww reaction time - push the menu key and wait for it to come up.i would explore other options,1
"after reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, i purchased.  here are the main issues i have found with this phone:  1) the buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  you have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. and, believe me, i do not have very large hands.  2) if you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  you will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) you must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  very inconvenient!!  there is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) on occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  what you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  not optimal, and i probably just got a bad phone, but i am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so i can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from motorola.  note:  i have no personal vendetta against motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff i bought into before purchasing",0
i returned this phone after one week. currntly the motoral software has a glitch and you can't assign specifice ring tones to phone number.ear piecs sound quality is marginal.text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small.the back panel display is too small and hard to read.,0
"i think that logitech make the best accessories.  i have the camera, the fancy dinovo bluetooth keyoard..... so naturally this headset was a no brainer.  the reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public.it worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the logitech bluetooh hub.  don't you find that strange?  aside from that, it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone (can't remember the model).  in addition, it really hurts my ears.. not the most comfortable.... so you decide if this product works for you.",0
"this headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  the other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and i'm asking them to repeat themselves. i've compared it with a couple other headsets i've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  actually, this headset has static problems anywhere - office, car, out walking, you name it.do yourself a favor and avoid this one",0
"i've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. there was no notice when it disconnected. recently the plastic ear clip broke and i contacted logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant",0
"i originally purchased the logitech mobile freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, logitech exchanged it for the mobile traveller. unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. i agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. it's true. it hurts.sound quality is very good. people say they can hear me just fine, and i can hear them just fine.but it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. what good is that? then when the phone rings, i don't hear it. then the clip broke on this one as well. logitech again replaced it. but how long will this one lsat? do yourself a favor and skip this one",1
this headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. you can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.as for the performance it is great. i drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and i can hear them just fine also. the volume is great and at times i have to turn it down in volume. have tried the anycomhs-890 and this outperforms it hands down. have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the anycom would at any time. i would definitely  reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. very satisified with the performance. tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. amazon needs to fix the edit system on this,1
"i've had two of these.  both sounded and worked well for a few months.  then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second.  when this happens, you're perfectly operating  earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery.  while it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of ""memory titanum"" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium i bet)   skip by this one if you're smart.  i've been had twice",1
"the charger was not compatible with my blackjack.  terrible product, not as advertised",0
"i ordered a motorola razr v3 mauve phone (unlocked)a month ago. i was hoping to get the color that i saw on the web page...and that's where the problem lies. the image shown is completely misleading.the phone that i received, was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the amazon web site.the mauve phone that i got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised. also,the phone had 2 different color tones. at night/in the lighting at night, the top part of the phone(the part that flips open) and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray.needless to say, i spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange.i didn't have to pay the shipping charges. the 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again, so for the 2nd time i returned it and got my money refunded.i gave 1 star due to the customer service provided, but again they could not help me. some one said it could be an item with a defect....but for methe whole experience was  disappointing.if you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand, and the 'color' which you will never get because amazon has put the wrong image on the web page...very misleading and wrong to all the customers.incidentally, this color as seen is offered by verizon and they call it 'pink', but amazon calls it 'mauve',though the phone and the image shown do not match. so stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone...all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted.",0
"i have never met anybody that has ear-holes big enough for these! i even tried superglue to put the things that fit inside the ear! that didnt work, so now i have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound & talk sitting in the seat next to me. i would not reccomend these to anybody. truth hurts & these hurt my ears",0
"i don't know about you folks, but i have small ears.  though the sound on these ear buds are good, i can't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they're too big for me, and forget about trying to walk and keep them in my ears.  unfortunately, this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords. good idea, badly designed for size differences.",0
this product stopped working after about a week or two... lesson learned: buy oem products instead of cheap knock-off,0
"amazon rebate is a scam.  i purchased this headset on 1/23/2007, and received it on 1/25/2007.  however, the rebateshq site was not functioning on 1/25/2007.  when it works the next day, it can not locate the offer number, nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture.  if you click on the url link supplied by amazon rebate form, you will be able to find the offer by amazon order number, however, they will disconnect you in the next step saying 'session expired'.  there is no way around, what a scam.  it's a shame for amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers.  it's $5.99, come on",0
"i bought this for my new samsung slider phone (which i love) but this case is to snug for it.  the slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out. it's a cute case, i would love to use if it was just a little larger.",1
"it was really cute when i got it.  two days later, the color started chipping away. the stones started falling off as well. i was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when i got it. i do not recommend buying it.",1
i bought this item at the end of january and received it in febuary it is now march and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry i bought this i am going to order another color and see if it does the same.  not very happy with this,0
"door stop....they have the m610 listed so i took a chance, but it will not charge the phone.  so, i'm out $10.00 (50% of the sprint price, however, sprint is out of stock right now...",1
"i am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for apple computers. samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac. the company i ordered the cable from is great, easy to work with, but once again it does not work on a mac. bummer. i have repeated that it does not work on a mac multiple times because i want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac. i blame samsung",1
it did not fit my phone and i was forced to go out and but another one,0
"i bought these adaptors to use regular head phones (3mm) with my cell phone mp-3 (lg cu500) player.  once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound. you only can hear the music through one ear.  whoever started the whole 2.5mm adaptor in cell phones should be put in jail.  it makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone.  i have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level.  they all have some type of flaw, the volume won't get loud enough, cord to short, poor sound, etc.",0
i received 2 2.5mm to 3.5mm stereo headphone adapter. one didn't work. the other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality. if you push the headphone jack(male) all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker. you have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers. and even then the quality is not good,1
"i would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort.  the 2.5 mm jack is slightly too small, creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active.  i tried both adapters (i bought the 2-pack) in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose.  in positive news, the connection at the 3.5 mm end is nicely snug",1
the adapter did not work when plugged in to a samsung m500. the sound only came out of one ear when plugged in,1
the color of the product i received is nothing like the picture! if you want royal blue then this is the case for you,0
i bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges.  doh!  this crappy case broke within 3 weeks of use.  i only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when i did.  no jostling or forcing the case.  the little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time.do not buy this pos unless you want to throw your money out,0
"i ordered one of these and it was dead on arrival.  also, notice that this is not a samsung oem part.  if you call to ask for tech support from samsung they will tell you they can't help you.  the only positive thing i have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless",1
"i go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it. when i got it in the mail i found that the c.d. they burned and sent with it would not work. you had to have the product license number, which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy. i was never able to get it too work. my advvice to you is not to buy this product, but if you want to chance it you may be lucky. i wasnt",1
cool concept and everything but when i tried to install the driver my cd-rom drive wouldnt even pick up that little cd,1
worked good for a few months.. then battery started draining fast.  now after just 1 or 2 calls the battery is dead.,0
"bought this because logitech has a great reputation with other products. i used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and i never found the battery life to be long enough. i actually went back to a jabra wired unit until recently, when i purchased a samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable, has good battery life, and the sound is better. i guess i prefer the in-ear style",1
"i have two of these head sets.  one never keeps its charge, pretty much from the time i bought it.  the other seems to charge alright.  the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime.the sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic.also it's big and heavy compared to the motorola i own.  i highly recomend the motorola. (sorry i dont know the model number off hand",1
"good sound nd price, nicely connect with mobile,,, however not work at all with my pc neither mac... once it's connected with my moble, they refuse to get in touch with any pc. they don't connect with 2 diveces in same time, it's ok,,,, but even if turn off my mobile nd renew all profile, still it's not changing. no connection with my pc,, so i was expecting use this for my skype but no way. real cheap gadget :",1
"the sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.i loved it when it wasn't broken.  even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  the voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  but the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  i got a new headset the first time on warranty.  the second time it broke i could have gotten a free replacement again but i didn't want the hassle.  i have a scala now that i've been using for months and i'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the logitech",1
i cannot believe how poor this product was made. the hell with this product. noboday noooooooooboooooody buy thsi product. talk about poor,0
"although this product is very nice, i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. to me the words ""charge all at once"" means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. however, this is not the case. this item is simply a method for organizing you devices. although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 i paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, i would return it. i feel that by using the words, ""charge all at once"" they are purposely misleading the customer.",1
"in the ad, this cable charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my treo. it will charge but i already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose. falsely calims to sync",0
"the phone is great .. and i knew it would be.  and i am a devoted amazon shopper.  my concern was always whether amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans ... a concern that has proved well founded.i was originally concerned because of feedback i had read on this site indicating the pearl ""shipped hot,"" with an active sim, which meant for those that -- like me - were upgrading (vs. new service), their existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route.  to be fair, that did not happen; however, i received the pearl with a sim card that the phone would not accept.the instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the sim, turn on the phone, and it will work.  and, if it doesn't work, it says, don't call cingular, call amazon.  i followed the instructions -- phone didn't work, i called amazon, at which point the csr told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 hours!!!unfortunately, i let the poor guy have it ... i told him what i truly believe, which is that it is completely unacceptable to tell me i have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone - which is supposed to work out of the box -- isn't working.so - 5 stars for the phone itself ... awesome!  2 stars for amazon ... they do not have the kinks worked out yet.  on a positive note -- i immediately called cingular, and they resolved the problem for me on the spot (sim was not activated / in the system)",1
i've purchased this car charger for my treo and theorder was delivered promptly. unfortunately theconnector that was suppose to go into my treo 650 did not fit (too big) so i wasn't able to connect it andcharge the phone. i send it back,0
this product was listed as being for my phone..when it arrived the cable did not list my phone model number and the software listed all other models. it was misleading. and it never worked even messed up my phone a little. and i lost 5.00 in shipping because of the decpetion,0
this product really needs installation assistance. too many options and i spent 2 hours trying to figure it out. i'm going to call to get more info. arrival time = ***** 5 starsprice = ***** 5 starsinstallation and ease = * 1 sta,1
"i bought this product, for my cell wich was listed on their description, and it so happens that the software will not work, they did not sent the drivers, i would not do business with this people again. this has not only been a waiste of money but also a waiste of time.  amazon should not permit them take people's money like that...   amazon suports those fakes",1
"junk! sent with a cd that had a usb driver but wouldn't work on two different computers. contacted the shipper, bargaincell, but their only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed. the email stated emphatically that they don't provide support for the product.",0
"i bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer.  the description stated that it would work for my selected model phone, however, it does not!!  the software needed to download the pictures is not correct. when we called the customer services they were of no help - they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem.  apparently i am not the only person to have this problem with the product.  again, the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are not accurate.  it does not work",0
"this product is the worst of its kind! it lasted a couple of months at the most, it is not at all worth the price, no matter how cheap. i picked one up at walmart for ten bucks that works great, don't waste your time on this one. it is cheap, but don't be had, stay away from this product",1
"my old audiovox phone, the 8500 was great. it fell in the toilet, though, and they didn't sell them anymore at the virgin webstore, so i bought the 8610 at a local sprint store. what a big mistake. it is awful with the poor sound quality, short battery life, horrible ringtones, and worst of all, i was unable to ever retrieve my voicemail! hello? and it has the most horrible graphics. does anyone want to buy it, along with all the accessories?? it is barely used...so i looked on ebay and found a used 8500 and bid on it, won it, and now i am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610. i like the 8500s micro-size, simplicity, ringtones, animated graphics, etc. i must be careful not to lose it, or drop it in the toilet again, though. my 8500 was replaced last year when i lost the first one, but i cannot get another replacement as i bought this one used.the pay as you go works fine for me as i do not want to have a cell phone clued to my head. i use it to check my land line for messages and for brief calls. do not buy the 8610, whatever you do",1
"this review is more about virgin mobil customer service than the phone. i ordered a vox 8610 on 1/22/2007 online thru virgin mobile. the phone wouldn't charge. i called customer service and explained the problem. they said did i want a charger or another phone. i replied that i could not tell if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a new kit.  i received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldn't charge. i called customer service and explained the issue and it must be the charger at fault. the rep said they would not send a new charger, that i would have to purchase one.  i said this didn't make any sense, according to the offer i could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charge  i need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to get a charger?  the support rep said yes and that i had to make up my mind - either return the phone or purchase a charger.  i asked to speak to a supervisor. the customer support rep kept going off line (to talk to someone?) but refused or couldn't get a supervisor to talk to me.  she then asked for the esn number of the phone. when i said i didn't know what an 'esn' number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the phone. i'm not clear why she needed this, since i haven't activated the phone and i already referenced the order (vmu) number.  at any rate i had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep (obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile) and  at least she was trying to track down some info - or so i thought - she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldn't handle my order - that i would have to call back.  i called back, had to work my way thru the answering system and got thru to rma and a fellow named mike.  mike  explained that they couldn't send a charger (none in stock) and that i would have to send the entire phone back - which is what i am now doing - 60+ minutes after the initial call. i have to say that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive. they customer service staff is  obviously  poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions.  the interfaces with support are youth geared - not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally.  i am sending the phone back for a refund and re-considering the provider for pay-as-you-go service.   01/26/2007.",1
"i have had this phone for about six months.  i replaced a kyocera that i disliked because it was so big, but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems.  the menus are very poorly designed, they are difficult to navigate and it's hard to do anything.  the ringer speaker is inside the phone, so when it's closed, it's almost impossible to hear.  i almost never hear it ring.  i usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on, but if you turn the phone off, the vibrate gets turned off, so you have to remember to turn that back on!  i hate this phone, and will be replacing it soon.",0
"i reluctantly bought this phone because my kyocera slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after vm's warranty was up and i had just purchased a $20 phone card + had airtime credits which were not refundable.  now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment.my kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches what-so-ever so i was pretty upset.after multiple calls and 2 emails to vm it was pretty clear they weren't going to do anything to help.      i was offered a replacement slider at $20.obviously i didn't want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying i had no other recourse but to purchase this audiovox 8610.by the way after i purchased the phone at a local store in town (when i called to activate the phone)they have the nerve to tell me that i could've purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of $24.99 because the slider died.the f!@%ng idiots!hello could ya not have told me sooner???and after i spent $50 + tax.sheesh!  anyway back to the phone review..the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here.its so low that if its in my purse i can't even hear it! wtf??? also the battery life sucks, no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half.it also doesnt get good service with the vm/sprint network, my slider had xcellent service w/it despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls.      so i've had it 5 days and i'm considering attempting to bring it back where i purchased it from.however i don't want to buy an expensive phone from vm because i'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them.  the way i see it vm leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell + they are expensive.i am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise.prior to these issues i was a happy vm customer but not anymore.",0
the phone may be fine but i will never know because my virgin mobile service never really worked. perhaps it was the phones fault i never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account. overall their customer service is awful. days of waiting and receiving no information. i had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right. i spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed. now i have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service. i plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone. its garbage.i went with the t-mobile sidekick and already am way happier,0
"this phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap. its useless, the software on it is very cheap and childish. not professional at all, the camera is pitiful, and the keys are too small for anyone who doesn't have 10yr old hands. just because it has a qwerty keyboard; that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash. purchase a different phone this one is not worth it",0
bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died one week after their return/replacement deadline.  shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month??  they refuse to refund or replace.  they are a shady company and i'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same,0
"i've had this thing for two weeks.  coming from the blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  work issued this and took away the blackberry and i'm stuck with it.  all i can do is whine on the internet, so here it goes. the more i use the thing the less i like it.  here's my list, good and bad.* battery life - attrocious.  use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  trust me.  grade: d.* navigation - cumbersome.  the keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  workable if you don't have huge hands.  grade: b* windows mobile - i hate it.  why do applications not quit when you end them?  instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  the menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from cingular, how convenient.  grade: c+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.* java is broken, google email doesn't work.  maps does work with the new version, thankfully.  grade: c.* no standard headphone jack.  hello??  this is suppose to be an mp3 player, right?  somebody explain to me why this is ok.  grade: f.* phone quality - grade a.  yes, they did something right.  the phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  bluetooth is great. * outlook & email - this is workable, but difficult.  you can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  if blackberry gets and ""a"" (and it does), blackjack gets a c.  it doesn't synch notes, so if you're an outlook notes person you're just left out, sorry.  why??* hardware quality - very good, b+.  the thing really feels solidly built.  the screen is vibrant and attractive.  the camera seems to work fine, although i may use it twice per year.in short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a blackberry.  if you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you.",1
"after owning 3 blackberry's over the years, i made the switch to the blackjack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. compared to the blackberry, the microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. on the plus side, the blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception i've ever experienced. the reason i only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. it's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. i called cingular first, who passed me on the samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, i was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. to my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. i've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and i always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that i've encountered this, i do feel it's worth considering. if you're thinking about a blackjack, i encourage you to be aware that, for one, the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys, and, that you may well be on your own when it comes to service. i feel that it's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not, the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right.",1
"you have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract.  the wire is very thin, so i'm thinking it will not last long",1
"i bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and it's nice to have one charging while i'm using the other--you don't have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone.  so i also bought one of boxwave's batteries for the 8525.well, the spare battery charger will charge the boxwave battery just fine, but it refuses to charge the battery that came with my 8525.  this really limits its usability as an off-line charging device.the cradle itself plugs into the usb port on the phone, which was not designed with cradling in mind, so it's not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle.  since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone (who's idea was that anyway?) it almost always gets pressed while i'm wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle.  this is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station.anyway, just my opinion, but it's actually easier to connect the standard usb charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle, so i'd recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard usb charger.if you really want to do all charging off-line you may need to buy two boxwave batteries instead of just one",1
i ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails!stay away not recommended,0
